Our team spans a wide range of disciplines, from neuroscience and machine learning to software engineering and interface design.
Job Description:
Were looking for an experienced UI Design Engineer to conceptualize, prototype, and ship novel computing interfaces tailored for BCI. Our ideal candidate will possess the following qualities:

Passion to explore an open-ended, multi-disciplinary, constrained space where design choices are informed by neural structure, model architecture, radio bandwidth, and more. For instance, a slight difference in an animated spring coefficient can change perceptual response time, shifting the alignment of labels and the performance of our decoders. You will actively collaborate with domain experts within and outside the team to understand these constraints and design your way around them
An intuitive sense for what level of fidelity to reach for when navigating this space, be it a conversation, a rough sketch, or a testable prototype
Excitement to work within and push the boundaries of an entirely new medium of interaction without the traditional sensory feedback of existing physical input devices (e.g., the kinetic friction of glass along the surface of a trackpad, or the resistive pressure of a spring during a keypress)
The ability to empathize with and design for people with a sensory experience that differs from your own, and ambition to build something that feels magical, beyond the local minima of that which works. Youll do whatever it might take to deliver that experience, be it a highly optimized vertex shader or a custom property animator, while maintaining an extremely high bar for fluidity and detail throughout
A strong point-of-view, without egoyou may occasionally pursue a hunch that not everyone on the team agrees with, but are relentless about testing, deleting, and learning from ideas that dont work

We are creating devices that enable a bi-directional interface with the brain. These devices allow us to restore movement to the paralyzed, restore sight to the blind, and revolutionize how humans interact with their digital world.Team Description:
The Infrastructure Team builds the foundation that enables the company to operate safely, robustly, and move at light-speed. We run a mixture of cloud-based and on-prem systems and have a user base spanning from highly technically proficient engineers to non-technical scientists and doctors; but all of them need solid systems, rugged networking, and bullet-proof software to do their jobs. This role will integrate tightly with teams across the company, and span all layers of the work environment stack, from deployment of physical hardware on the manufacturing line to custom tooling built to facilitate neural recordings from implants.
Job Responsibilities and Description:

Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to ensure the seamless operation of our systems, accelerating our progress as safely and quickly as possible.
Solve problems spanning from physical hardware deployment on the manufacturing line to high-level cloud architecture for distributed systems.
Drive initiatives to encourage best practices, such as revamping the operating system deployment and provisioning for our surgical robot, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
Extract critical metrics from systems and monitors, such as our microfab cleanroom to monitor and enhance operational efficiency for implant &amp; thread manufacturing.
Partner with the teams across the company to build a robust infrastructure, such as with the Clinical team for our Patient Registry, identifying suitable participants for our groundbreaking research.
Build and contribute to systems such as the Webgrid application used to perform  Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) tasks.
Provide technical leadership in software engineering across the entire company.

Key Qualifications:

Robust software engineering skills, and a track record of building tools &amp; systems that solve problems or automate processes, particularly for software engineering.
A solid understanding of core networking protocols, TCP/IP, UDP, ARP, DNS, DHCP, and an understanding of the OSI model of networking.
Experience administrating modern Linux systems in production or production-like environments.
Experience building hybrid cloud/on-prem infrastructure, in a codified manner, and with an understanding of the trade-offs of cloud vs on-prem solutions.
Strong computer security fundamentals, and a drive for building systems that are simpler, faster, and more secure.
Experience with the application of technical skills outside of the classroom (examples: laboratory, research, extracurricular project teams, open source contributions, volunteering, personal projects, or prior internship/work experience).

Preferred Qualifications:

Experience using IAC tools such as Terraform, Docker, Packer, Ansible, Cloud-Init, and/or Kickstart.
Working knowledge of compiled languages, ideally Rust or C/C++.
Working knowledge of major cryptographic protocols and authentication schemes such as TLS, x509, 802.1x, U2F, SAML.
Systems administration experience on Windows and macOS.
Experience supporting production lines, medical systems, and/or laboratory settings.
