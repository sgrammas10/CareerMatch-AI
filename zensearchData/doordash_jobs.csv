Drive is DoorDash’s first party delivery-as-a-service platform, and is one of the fastest growing segments within DoorDash. Its purpose is to realize DoorDash’s mission of empowering local businesses everywhere by expanding access to DoorDash’s delivery capabilities. With Drive, merchants receive orders through their first-party channels (leveraging their own brand identity and voice), and utilize DoorDash’s delivery fleet to fulfill the order. Drive powers delivery for businesses small and large, from local neighborhood restaurants to national brands with thousands of locations.

Own product areas end to end, contribute to product strategy, run design sprints, and craft visions
Work cross-functionally with product managers, engineers, and other disciplines to build and ship your designs
Create, collaborate, and iterate on flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity visuals

You are a senior-level IC with 5+ years of work experience
You are all about 0 to 1, and enjoy driving clarity in ambiguous spaces
You are hands-on and passionate about contributing to product strategy and vision for new product areas 
You think of yourself as a craftsperson, have a passion for visual design, and usually find yourself sweating over the details

Our Merchant Services team lies at the heart and soul of DoorDash, ensuring that we set all of our merchants up for success by providing a seamless onboarding, menu, and photo experience. As DoorDash grows both in scale and scope of offering, the strength of our merchant services engine must grow with it. The Premium Resolution Partner team plays a pivotal role in this evolution by managing highly complex issues, adapting to changing business needs, and owning strategically significant processes, primarily related to Merchant Change of Ownership (COO) requests.
About the Role
We are looking for a Premium Resolution Partner to provide a best-in-class support experience to Merchants who need it most. As a Premium Resolution Partner, you will serve as a Merchant’s direct point of contact, guiding them as they navigate multifaceted, often highly complex problems, with a focus on Change of Ownership (COO) requests. These and similar requests require the exercise of discretion in determining which problems require high-touch solutions, a deep understanding of our internal systems, policies, and partners, as well as the ability to apply strategic problem-solving and independent judgment to ensure optimal outcomes.
As the end-to-end owner of these requests, not only will you partner closely with our Merchants, but you will also work with Account Owners, Product, and Strategy teams - identifying and advocating for Merchants’ needs, as well as proactively proposing improvements to internal processes. You will ensure that the Merchant voice informs key operational decisions. As an agile thinker, you’ll be prepared to pivot from COO responsibilities to other challenging escalations and non-COO duties as the business evolves. In the future, you may also handle some of DoorDash’s most intricate Merchant escalations, showcasing your versatility, adaptability, and ability to guide the organization through complex, high-impact changes.
By joining this team, you will help shape support as a strategic differentiator in the marketplace. Your contributions will not only promote Merchant success but also influence broader business strategies, internal workflows, and product enhancements, solidifying your role as an integral and trusted advisor within DoorDash.
You’re excited about this opportunity because you will…

Select and Own Merchant Cases: As a Single Point of Ownership for Merchants, you will select the most complex cases to solve, and work them end to end, resolving only when all parties, including cross functional partners, have completed requirements and the merchant has agreed the issue is resolved.
Serve as a Strategic Advisor: Develop subject matter expertise in handling Change of Ownership (COO) scenarios, ensuring Merchants are guided with precision and care through an intricate transition process.
Adapt and Overcome: Anticipate potential issues, execute strategic problem-solving tactics, and pivot to non-COO related responsibilities as business needs evolve, including the future management of the company’s most complex, high-level escalations.
Build Strong Relationships: Interact and build long-term partnerships with Merchants through multiple channels (phone, video-calling, text, email), meeting them where they are and delivering white-glove service that influences their overall experience with DoorDash.
Provide Proactive Recommendations: Leverage insights from challenging Merchant scenarios to propose targeted improvements to product, policy, and support processes, acting as a liaison between Merchants and internal teams.
Drive Merchant Centric Innovation: Collaborate with Product, Strategy, and Account Management teams to surface key themes, develop long-term solutions, and ensure that policies, tools, and systems evolve to better serve Merchant needs.
Influence Business Operations: Apply critical thinking to inform operational decisions, introduce scalable improvements, and guide DoorDash towards defect free, differentiated support offerings.

We’re excited about you because…

You have 3-5  years of experience in account management, customer support, retail, hospitality, or a related field where you exercised judgment and influenced outcomes.
You excel at complex problem-solving and have experience tackling multifaceted issues that require detailed analysis, strategic thinking, and strong communication skills.
You have demonstrated the ability to adapt quickly, shifting focus from one set of responsibilities (e.g., COO) to handling the most difficult and intricate escalations as needs arise.
You’re comfortable serving as an advisor and advocate for customers, influencing internal stakeholders and ensuring a consistent, high-quality merchant experience.
You excel at determining prioritization, navigating ambiguous scenarios, and proactively recommending tailored solutions.
You bring expertise with Salesforce (or other CRM software), Microsoft suite, and G Suite—tools you will leverage to analyze data, streamline processes, and communicate effectively.
