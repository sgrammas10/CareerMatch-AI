We identify, evaluate, and deploy solutions to support successful operator and customer outcomes as we build the DashMart of the Future. You will be responsible for the full lifecycle of strategic technology launches within our DashMarts: from building and managing a pipeline of internal and external technology partners, to identifying opportunities and payback of potential investments, to launching and expanding our new technologies and processes within our DashMarts. You will wear both strategic and operational hats - you will interface with vendors and maintain key customer relationships on behalf of DashMart while also tactically designing operational processes to integrate technology with existing operations, creating and metricizing success criteria, and identifying and actioning areas for improvement and further investment. You will report to the Senior Manager on our DashMart Strategy &amp; Operations; we operate in a hybrid model - you will spend some time in your home office, in person via offsites and remotely as well.

Lead and collaborate. Youll work with a cross-functional team, including local operations, engineering, and space planning teams.

Were excited about you because...

You solve problems from first principles. Youre excited to solve problems in innovative ways, and you resist this is how its always been done thinking.
Youre equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You dont hesitate to get in the weeds and operate at the lowest level of detail, but youre just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team. No job is beneath you.
Youre unafraid of ambiguity. Rapid change and learning is exciting to you, and you thrive in ambiguous, startup environments
Youre analytical. You let data win arguments, and youre comfortable pulling your own data in SQL or modeling in Excel.
You have 6-8+ years of professional experience. Youve succeeded in high-performance cultures (whether in tech, operations, strategy, consulting, manufacturing, automation, engineering, etc).
You have 2+ years of experience in a physical retail or warehousing environment. You have completed your BS/BA Degree preferably in Industrial Engineering, Supply Chain, or a related field.
