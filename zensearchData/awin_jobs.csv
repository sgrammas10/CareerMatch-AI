Retention of customers to ensure sustainable continuity
Growth of our portfolio in line with GP and ARR targets

With retention in mind, this team will lead the migration of customers onto MarTech commercials as part of our business transformation.
Alongside this the team will also be the home for revenue optimisation through the methods of; upselling customers to a higher Platform Offer or Service Package, cross-selling additional services or add-ons, expanding into new markets or opening-up additional programmes, or alternatively downgrading customers to a more suitable Platform Offer or Service Package that meets their needs.
The R&amp;G Manager role is responsible for overseeing the migration and therefore negotiation of customers to new MarTech contracts at local market level, and achieving the targets set by their R&amp;G Team Leader.
The role will report directly into their local R&amp;G Team Leader who will support with direct line management and training, with the wider team reporting back to the Global Migration Manager focussed on R&amp;G team alignment on things like processes and progress reporting.
The role at its core will require ownership of customer relationships on the topic of renegotiations, upsell, and downgrade opportunities – ending in signed contract.
For the purpose of Retention &amp; Growth this role will be expected to liaise with many other departments within the business including Client Services, GtM, GBOps, Legal, Info-sec, Finance and our technical teams to name the most common.
The R&amp;G team are committed to working as a virtual team – exchanging knowledge, aligning processes, and delivering data and insights from their teams. This team is also likely to support other market R&amp;G teams where needed and therefore not isolated to one single market support.
Key Tasks

Drafting, reviewing and executing agreements (including but not limited to Contracts, Renegotiations/Renewals, Upgrades, Downgrades, Non-Disclosure Agreements, Partner or Third-Party Agreements, etc.).
Negotiating directly where appropriate with client contacts with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable solution that remains within our MarTech strategy and connected to our GP and ARR targets.
