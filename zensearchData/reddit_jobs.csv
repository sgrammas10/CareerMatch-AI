The Business Experience team’s mission is to empower brands, organizations and professionals to create engaging content for our communities while growing their presence on Reddit through Reddit Pro. Reddit Pro is an ongoing initiative that offers advanced tooling for businesses that unlocks the power of Reddit’s 100k active communities &amp; conversations – where opinions are formed and decisions are made. Longer term, businesses will also be able to build on this deep relationship with their Reddit communities by leveraging complementary monetized solutions from Reddit.

The Compute Reliability and Efficiency team is looking to hire a Staff Software Engineer with a focus on lower-level (Linux and Kubernetes) systems engineering that thrives at the intersection of infrastructure and software engineering. 
At Reddit, our Compute organization breaks down into 2 teams:

Compute Reliability and Efficiency (CRE)
Compute Platform and Orchestration (CPO)

CRE: Intra-cluster engineering problems focused on balancing performance, efficiency, and stability. A subset of focus areas include:

Detection of node-level (Linux) performance characteristics and making availability decisions based on the data.
Schedulers that support more efficient packing of resources along with reactive rescheduling on the basis of changing compute availability.
Lower-level Kubernetes integrations such as CSI drivers, node probs, and kernel-level observability.
Cluster upgrades, both mechanical process concerns and automation.

CPO: Higher-level orchestration of both compute capacity and workload primitives to support our multi-cloud, multi-region, deployments. A subset of current focuses include:

Software automation that creates, manages, and destroys clusters in our fleet.
APIs and controllers that support multi-cluster deployment and scheduling mechanics.
Core SDKs that enable controller development in the larger organization.
Software that codifies out-of-cluster ancillary concerns such as network configurations and managed services.

As a member of the Compute Reliability and Efficiency team, you’ll be solving some of the world’s largest at-scale infrastructure problems using software we create along with integrating services from the cloud native ecosystem. Your work will directly impact hundreds of millions of users around the world. Join us and help build the future of Reddit!
In your day-to-day, you can expect to:

Work collaboratively with a team of software engineers to create and maintain the foundational platform for running Reddit’s infrastructure.
Execute performance and reliability analysis on our Linux-based Kubernetes fleet.
Design, write (Golang), and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of Reddit’s Compute Platform.
Contribute feedback to the technical and strategic direction of the compute platform.
Automate critical aspects of the development process such as service creation and management, as well as critical infrastructure operations.
Share on-call responsibilities with the Compute team. 

You have:

7+ years of experience working in the infrastructure domain – with a focus on lower-level systems such as Linux.

Language proficiency in either Go (Preferred), Rust, or Python.
Understanding of kernel primitives (cgroups, namespaces), cpu scheduling, userspace concerns, and packet processing.

Experience developing on top of Kubernetes or similar distributed systems.
Strong troubleshooting competency ranging from higher-level orchestration concerns to lower-level runtime ones.
Experience designing large systems, scoping work, and building consensus with other engineers.
Excellent communication skills to collaborate with a service-oriented team and company.

Senior Backend Engineer, Consumer Product Teams
We’re working on many exciting things at Reddit and you may likely want to be considered for more than one team. We get it! Our recruiting team works diligently to consider your interests while balancing the needs of the business to place you in the right role at the right time. When you apply to this posting, we will consider you for the following teams listed below. 
Reddit Pro - Publisher Experience
The Reddit Pro team’s mission is to empower brands, organizations and professionals to create engaging content for our communities while growing their presence on Reddit through Reddit Pro. Reddit Pro is an ongoing initiative that offers advanced tooling for businesses that unlocks the power of Reddit’s 100k active communities &amp; conversations – where opinions are formed and decisions are made. Longer term, businesses will also be able to build on this deep relationship with their Reddit communities by leveraging complementary monetized solutions from Reddit.
Consumer Profiles
Reddit’s consumer profile is a central part of a Redditor’s world and acts as a key entry point to their interests and contributions on Reddit. The Profiles team is focused on making profiles an open, safe and expressive part of Reddit for all users, further encouraging growth in user contributions. This is a high impact role where you will be involved in related technical and product strategy, operations, architecture and execution for a high traffic and large website.
Ranking Foundation
As a core member of the Ranking Foundation team, you’ll work with the billions of events and terabytes of data generated every day to personalize Reddit posts and comments for each user on the platform, helping them connect and engage with their communities while discovering the best of Reddit. You will own projects from ideation to production instead of being stuck making small incremental gains on enterprise systems. You'll work with a super talented, cross-functional team to solve hard problems in order to create experiences that users will love.
User Economy
As a core member of Reddit’s User Economy team, you will be leading an exciting initiative that enables users to earn money through various Reddit products such as Awards, Premium, Collectible Avatars, and more. We’re redefining how users engage with and monetize their contributions, shaping the future of Reddit’s creator ecosystem.
You'll drive high-impact projects, working at the intersection of backend systems, monetization, and platform scalability. We've successfully launched key features and are expanding the team to build new, innovative ways for users to earn on Reddit.
What You’ll Do:

Work cross-functionally with product, design, and other engineering counterparts to execute on product and business strategy and build novel products and features that our users will love.
Contribute to the full development cycle: technical design, development, test, experimentation, analysis, and launch. You’ll be reviewing code and design docs, giving feedback on product specs and mocks.
Participate with a team of thoughtful, fast-moving, and motivated engineers. Contribute to standards that improve developer workflows, recommend best practices, and help mentor junior engineers on the team to grow their technical expertise.
Move fast while balancing quality. We can’t afford extensive processes, and we also can’t afford show-stopping bugs. We need someone who can balance speed with quality while quickly building brand-new products.

Who You Might Be:

BS degree in Computer Science, a similar technical field of study or equivalent practical experience
3+ years of industry experience in large-scale distributed systems. 
5+ years of hands-on, professional software development experience in one or more general purpose programming languages (Go, Python, Ruby, Java, C++)
Experience working with ML teams and systems is a plus, but not mandatory.
Experienced with GraphQL, REST, HTTP, Thrift basics, and the ability to design and implement maintainable APIs
Experienced with distributed caching layers, and distributed large scale data storage systems like Cassandra.
A track record of developing and improving highly scalable and reliable serving systems
A track record of leading sized projects that require cross-team and cross-functional collaborations
Strong organizational skills, the ability to prioritize tasks and to deliver projects on schedule
Entrepreneurial spirit. You are self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You love to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure
Excellent communication skills. You partner effectively with teams in a fully remote environment and discuss complex topics with technical and non-technical audiences
