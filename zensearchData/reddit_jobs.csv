Lower-level Kubernetes integrations such as CSI drivers, node probs, and kernel-level observability.
Cluster upgrades, both mechanical process concerns and automation.

CPO: Higher-level orchestration of both compute capacity and workload primitives to support our multi-cloud, multi-region, deployments. A subset of current focuses include:

Software automation that creates, manages, and destroys clusters in our fleet.
APIs and controllers that support multi-cluster deployment and scheduling mechanics.
Core SDKs that enable controller development in the larger organization.
Software that codifies out-of-cluster ancillary concerns such as network configurations and managed services.

As a member of the Compute Reliability and Efficiency team, youll be solving some of the worlds largest at-scale infrastructure problems using software we create along with integrating services from the cloud native ecosystem. Your work will directly impact hundreds of millions of users around the world. Join us and help build the future of Reddit!
In your day-to-day, you can expect to:

Work collaboratively with a team of software engineers to create and maintain the foundational platform for running Reddits infrastructure.

Contribute feedback to the technical and strategic direction of the compute platform.
Automate critical aspects of the development process such as service creation and management, as well as critical infrastructure operations.
Share on-call responsibilities with the Compute team. 

You have:

7+ years of experience working in the infrastructure domain  with a focus on lower-level systems such as Linux.

Language proficiency in either Go (Preferred), Rust, or Python.
Understanding of kernel primitives (cgroups, namespaces), cpu scheduling, userspace concerns, and packet processing.

Experience developing on top of Kubernetes or similar distributed systems.
Strong troubleshooting competency ranging from higher-level orchestration concerns to lower-level runtime ones.
