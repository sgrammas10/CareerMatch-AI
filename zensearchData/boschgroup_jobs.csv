This already leads to realistic load requirements in a Frhen development phase and contributes to a targeted and accelerated product development. A challenge in the simulation of vehicle loads is to determine realistic usage patterns and use scenarios of vehicles. As a rule, these are derived on the basis of data on the driving and usage behavior of individual persons, which means that reprodentative usage patterns as well as routes and regional traffic properties can be described for the simulation of loads on the vehicle. However, there are various problems in the derivation of these repressant patterns, which range from the incomplete data about the bias contained in the data to the evaluation of the represents. The focus is on the development and use of methods of complete analysis, the reproductive pacoism and non -parametric statistics. As part of your thesis, you will get to know methods of virtual load capacity.
