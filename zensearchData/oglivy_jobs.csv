About the Role
At Ogilvy Health, Copy Supervisors are viewed as vital to team success for their ability to create, direct and represent outstanding creative work. They prove themselves to be invested beyond their core creative responsibilities by demonstrating a heightened sensitivity/understanding of the strategic imperatives and market dynamics. The team has complete trust in their ability to consistently contribute strong conceptual ideas, innovative/experiential executions and top-notch digital/print designs.
Being more fully immersed in the strategic/business-oriented aspects of their brands and the financial health of the agency distinguishes copy supervisors from their previous level. They become more comfortable in identifying/allocating appropriate resources (in-house/freelance) and become less-reliant on the direction of top tier creatives. They also focus on developing respectful and productive partnerships within the broader team.
