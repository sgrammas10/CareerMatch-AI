MongoDB is currently building out a team based in Mexico City to execute current and upcoming Performance Testing. This is a dedicated team to complete competitive and sales performance testing, benchmarking MongoDB against competitors. Alongside seeking experienced engineers, we are seeking a team manager/leader. 
The testing roadmap of the team will be made up of long-term strategic testing plans in order to gain more insight and build documentation on the competitive landscape compared to MongoDB. In parallel, the testing roadmap will also be made up of short-term tests that will come up in order to aid in deal support (i.e. a customer who is weighing MongoDB against a competitor); these tests come up more spontaneously and as-needed, which is why we are building a dedicated team to meet this demand. 
We are seeking a thought leader, technical expert, and most importantly, a people leader, to manage a high-performing team. This is a role that requires natural leadership skills and the ability to work cross-functionally with various teams, such as Engineering, Product, and Sales. You will play a key part in driving forward major projects, advocating for your team, implementing new processes, cultivating team culture, promoting team mentorship, and retaining talent. This role is for an individual who is detail-oriented, a strong project overseer, collaborative, a strong communicator with a high emotional IQ, and a thought leader who will set the example of raising the bar for team expectations. 
The Lead Performance Testing Engineer will report directly to a Director of Industry Solutions Team (IST). 
MongoDB prioritizes its people, and we intend for this team to be an exciting opportunity, made up of ambitious, innovative thinkers wanting to step up as leaders. Learn more about #LifeAtMongoDB here.
