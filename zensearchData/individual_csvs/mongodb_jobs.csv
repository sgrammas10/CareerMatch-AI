During your internship, you will have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on a production codebase with a team committed to you having a positive experience!
Field EngineeringThe Field Engineering organization is a fast-paced, entrepreneurial team whose focus is bridging the gap between MongoDB official database products and the reality of our services organizations who are boots on the ground and often rely upon quickly created tools to assist customers with modernizing their application code and architectures. The sort of projects we work on are varied, but include a combination of research, proof of concept, and product development. Since we focus on GenAI, this includes working with LLMs, parsing tools, agentic frameworks, etc. Our tools are immediately usable, experimented on, and then refined by a broad engineering team worldwide.
As an intern, you will work on one or more of these GenAI projects with dedicated mentors who will help you learn the nuances of product software development.
