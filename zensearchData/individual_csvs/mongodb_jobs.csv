About the Role
Were looking for a Staff Engineer to join our team building the inference platform for embedding models that power semantic search, retrieval, and AI-native features across MongoDB Atlas.
This role is part of the broader Search and AI Platform team and involves close collaboration with AI engineers and researchers from our Voyage.ai acquisition, who are developing industry-leading embedding models. Together, were building the infrastructure that enables real-time, high-scale, and low-latency inference  all deeply integrated into Atlas and optimized for developer experience.
As a Staff Engineer, youll be hands-on with design and implementation, while working with engineers across experience levels to build a robust, scalable system. The focus is on latency, availability, observability, and scalability in a multi-tenant, cloud-native environment.
What Youll Do

Partner with Search Platform and Voyage.ai AI engineers and researchers to productionize state-of-the-art embedding models and rerankers, supporting both batch and real-time inference
Lead key projects around performance optimization, GPU utilization, autoscaling, and observability for the inference platform
Design and build components of a multi-tenant inference service that integrates with Atlas Vector Search, driving capabilities for semantic search and hybrid retrieval
Contribute to platform features like model versioning, safe deployment pipelines, latency-aware routing, and model health monitoring
Collaborate with peers across ML, infra, and product teams to define architectural patterns and operational practices that support high availability and low latency at scale
Guide decisions on model serving architecture using tools like vLLM, ONNX Runtime, and container orchestration in Kubernetes

Who You Are

8+ years of engineering experience in backend systems, ML infrastructure, or scalable platform development
Expertise in serving embedding models in production environments
Strong systems skills in languages like Go, Rust, C++, or Python, and experience profiling and optimizing performance
Comfortable working on cloud-native distributed systems, with a focus on latency, availability, and observability
Familiarity with inference runtimes and vector search systems (e.g., Faiss, HNSW, ScaNN)
Proven ability to collaborate across disciplines and experience levels, from ML researchers to junior engineers
Experience with high-scale SaaS infrastructure, particularly in multi-tenant environments

Nice to Have
