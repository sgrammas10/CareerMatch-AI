We're seeking a Staff Software Engineer with a strong background in computer science fundamentals, systems design, and extensive experience in modernization to join our engineering team. In this role, you will play a crucial part in designing, building, and optimizing the underlying data structures, algorithms, and database interactions that power our generative AI platform and code generation tools. This involves crafting sophisticated orchestration layers, robust integration points, and high-performance data systems that seamlessly connect and leverage advanced AI capabilities for code generation. While our immediate focus is on this domain, this role emphasizes strong foundational engineering principles that apply broadly to complex, high-performance systems. Deep prior experience with AI models or machine learning is not a requirement; your firm grasp of core computer science is what matters most, and you'll be given ample time and resources to build expertise in the AI domain. You will work on critical components that ensure the scalability, efficiency, and reliability of our services, collaborating closely with AI researchers and other engineers to translate complex requirements into robust technical solutions.
As a Staff Engineer, you'll be hands-on with design and implementation, while working with engineers across experience levels to build a robust, scalable system. The focus is on performance, correctness, and architectural excellence in a rapidly evolving, data-intensive environment.
Many organizations have amassed extensive portfolios of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, lengthy development times, high operating costs, and the inability to run on the cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernization programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems, offering the best scalability, resiliency, and developer experience in both the cloud and on-premises environments. Organizations continuously migrate workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB.
Such transformations are very time-intensive and often risky. MongoDB is bolstering its team by creating tools that guide customers in transitioning their applications from relational databases to MongoDB. As businesses evolve their application development frameworks, they're increasingly drawn to the versatility of the document model. 
Position Expectations

Execute a comprehensive code modernization strategy that aligns transitioned code with cutting-edge practices
Design, implement, and optimize high-performance data structures and algorithms for core components of our generative AI orchestration platform
Design and optimize sophisticated code parsers to transform legacy code structures using techniques such as AST, into standardized formats

We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhereon premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, its no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.
We're seeking a Staff Software Engineer with a strong background in computer science fundamentals, systems design, and extensive experience in modernization to join our engineering team. In this role, you will play a crucial part in designing, building, and optimizing the underlying data structures, algorithms, and database interactions that power our generative AI platform and code generation tools. This involves crafting sophisticated orchestration layers, robust integration points, and high-performance data systems that seamlessly connect and leverage advanced AI capabilities for code generation. While our immediate focus is on this domain, this role emphasizes strong foundational engineering principles that apply broadly to complex, high-performance systems. Deep prior experience with AI models or machine learning is not a requirement; your firm grasp of core computer science is what matters most, and you'll be given ample time and resources to build expertise in the AI domain. You will work on critical components that ensure the scalability, efficiency, and reliability of our services, collaborating closely with AI researchers and other engineers to translate complex requirements into robust technical solutions.
As a Staff Engineer, you'll be hands-on with design and implementation, while working with engineers across experience levels to build a robust, scalable system. The focus is on performance, correctness, and architectural excellence in a rapidly evolving, data-intensive environment.
Many organizations have amassed extensive portfolios of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, lengthy development times, high operating costs, and the inability to run on the cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernization programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems, offering the best scalability, resiliency, and developer experience in both the cloud and on-premises environments. Organizations continuously migrate workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB.
Such transformations are very time-intensive and often risky. MongoDB is bolstering its team by creating tools that guide customers in transitioning their applications from relational databases to MongoDB. As businesses evolve their application development frameworks, they're increasingly drawn to the versatility of the document model. 
This role will be based remotely in North America.
