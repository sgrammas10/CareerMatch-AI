With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, its no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.
As a Senior Curriculum Engineer, you'll work with a team of creative educators and software engineers dedicated to building the future of online technical education, developing courses for MongoDB University. 
MongoDB University is the online training department of MongoDB and is chartered with building high quality training at a basic and advanced level across the entire MongoDB product stack. The University team is focused on creating skill-based learning content, designed to equip enterprise users and a general audience with the core skills needed to successfully use MongoDB.
Your work will directly impact the learning experience of millions of developers around the world, helping them become experts in the field by honing their skills on the fastest growing modern database. 
What Youll Do
Youll work closely with a team of curriculum engineers, curriculum designers, and in-house subject-matter experts to build course materials focused on upskilling enterprise customers and a general learning audience. You'll write learning videos, design hands-on labs, and ensure these MongoDB learning resources are relevant, interactive, and reflect the challenges developers encounter in the real world. 
In this role, we expect you to continually grow your knowledge of MongoDB and become an expert who knows a subset of MongoDB offerings in depth. You will articulate the key concepts and skills that need to be covered in a training course, write course materials for an enterprise audience, design the hands-on exercises and also support the creation of skill badges that assess a learner's knowledge.
If you are a current Developer or a current Administrator of MongoDB, you will be able to add a lot of value to the team as we strive for our training to be from experts who already use our products. If you currently provide technical assistance or consulting for MongoDB solutions, you will also be able to add value to this team. If you are new to MongoDB, you'll be expected to learn MongoDB products quickly and articulate how they work. 
In this team, you will also get access to experts throughout the company and stay cutting edge on your technical skills and expertise.
