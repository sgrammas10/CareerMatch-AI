The MongoDB Catalog and Routing team carries the important responsibility of hiding the complexity of building a distributed database system. They implement scalable interfaces with strong consistency guarantees which are used by other MongoDB developers to navigate and organize user data. As a result, their work has a direct impact on the productivity of the entire organization and the success of MongoDBs horizontal scaling strategy.
Recent work includes the ability to move unpartitionable data sets across multiple nodes without splitting a tables keyspace, colocating cluster service in the same process in order to reduce resources consumption and operational complexity of running a sharded cluster, and the ability to perform concurrent data definition operations.
We are looking to speak to candidates who are based in Barcelona for our hybrid working model.
Candidate Profile
Successful candidates will have majority of the following qualities:

Shown success in writing, testing and maintaining distributed and/or concurrent software systems
Experience with imperative programming and object oriented languages, preferably working with C/C++ (or willingness to learn new languages)
Proven experience in programming and debugging with a strong grip on computer science fundamentals.
Professional or advanced academic expertise in the areas of distributed systems and databases is preferable, but not strongly required
Excellent verbal and written technical communication skills and desire to collaborate with colleagues and mentor interns
Regardless of prior experience, they are willing, able and excited to quickly learn new things in the domains of computer science and software engineering. They are curious about how people and organizations use MongoDB, and how MongoDB could be improved to enable more uses

Position Expectations

Understand and improve current functionality in MongoDBs catalog and routing components
Identify, design, implement, test and support new features in MongoDB
Work with other specialists to coordinate flawless changes in a feature-rich, large code base
Estimate task complexity and report progress and risks to peers and managers
Learn from and teach peers
Develop and maintain expertise in the modern practice and research of distributed systems and databases

Success Measures

In the first month you will have understood the surface area and the high level architecture of MongoDB distributed catalog, become familiar with the code areas with which it interfaces and fixed a few bugs
In three months you will have contributed to the development in C++ of a project slated for the next major release of MongoDB and diagnosed and fixed a few customer or testing-reported issues
In six months, you will have tackled code review responsibilities and are involved in reviewing the design for new features
In twelve months, you are owning the development of a new feature and are helping to mentor new engineers on the team
