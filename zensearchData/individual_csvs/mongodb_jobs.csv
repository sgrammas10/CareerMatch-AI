We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhereon premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, its no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.
We're looking for a Software Engineer with a strong background in computer science fundamentals and systems design to join our engineering team. In this role, you will play a key part in building and optimizing the underlying data structures, algorithms, and database interactions that power our generative AI platform and code generation tools. This involves crafting sophisticated orchestration layers, robust integration points, and high-performance data systems that seamlessly connect and leverage advanced AI capabilities for code generation. While our immediate focus is on this domain, this role emphasizes strong foundational engineering principles that apply broadly to complex, high-performance systems. Deep prior experience with AI models or machine learning is not a requirement; your strong grasp of core computer science is what matters most, and you'll be given ample time and resources to build expertise in the AI domain. You will work on critical components that ensure the scalability, efficiency, and reliability of our services, collaborating closely with AI researchers and other engineers to translate complex requirements into robust technical solutions.
As a Software Engineer on our team, you'll be hands-on with implementation and problem-solving, working with engineers across experience levels to build a robust, scalable system. The focus is on performance, correctness, and architectural excellence in a rapidly evolving, data-intensive environment.
Many organizations have built up large estates of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, long development times, operating costs, and inability to run on the cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernization programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency, and developer experience in the cloud and on-premises. Organizations continuously migrate workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB. 
Such transformations are very time-intensive and often risky. MongoDB is bolstering its team by creating tools that guide customers in transitioning their applications from relational databases to MongoDB. As businesses evolve their application development frameworks, they're increasingly drawn to the versatility of the document model. The Application Modernization team, already instrumental in this area, aids developers in making the shift from relational databases to MongoDB via Relational Migrator. Now, they're broadening their toolkit and are keen on modernizing code using a mix of AI and traditional text processing.
This role can be based out of our MongoDB offices or remotely in the US and Canada.

We are looking for passionate technologists to join our Pre-Sales organization to ensure that our growth is grounded and guided by strong technical alignment with our platform and the needs of our customers.
MongoDB Pre-Sales Solution Architects are responsible for guiding our customers and users to design and build reliable, scalable systems using our data platform. Our team is made up of seasoned technical sales professionals, software architects, entrepreneurs, and developers who take direct responsibility for customer success, including the design of their software, deployment, and operations. You'll work closely with our sales executives, helping customers solve business problems by leveraging our solutions, playing a key role in winning deals and driving the business forward. You'll be a trusted advisor to a wide range of users from startups to the world's largest enterprise IT organizations. 
As MongoDB continues to expand product offerings and features within the MongoDB Atlas Data Platform, MongoDB is seeking an expert in data streaming. This role will focus on being a product specialist of Atlas Stream Processing within the presales organization. Beyond the normal tasks of a MongoDB Solutions Architect, this specialist role will operate in a worldwide team, assist in the most complex deal cycles, assist in enablement, and work closely with the product team to close the feedback loop and further enhance the product moving forward. 
Atlas Stream Processing (ASP) is a MongoDB-native way to process streaming data, transforming the way developers build modern applications. With ASP, developers use the MongoDB aggregation framework to process the rich and complex data found in streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka. This unlocks new, powerful ways to continuously process streaming data (e.g., aggregate, filter, route, alert, and emit) and materialize results into Atlas or back into the streaming platform for consumption by other systems. Atlas Stream Processing makes stream processing a native capability of Atlas, enabling developers to unify all of the data required to power their applications.
ASP is ideal for industries that have large and diverse real-time data processing requirements, as are often found within the network security, fintech, IoT, manufacturing, oil and gas, and aerospace industries. Examples of great-fit use cases include using streaming data to power applications ranging from fraud/anomaly detection, systems monitoring, algorithmic trading, predictive maintenance, device telemetry, click-stream analysis, real-time recommendation engines, and more. Specifically, ideal use cases for ASP are where developers need to build applications that react to data in near real-time and want to use MQL and the document model.
This role will be based remotely in North America, with a preference towards one of our hub offices in the East Coast. The Specialist will be a critical part of the Go To Market team, writing memos to the executive team to shape our market approach and product strategy. They will work closely with a dedicated ASP seller focused on migration plays, land and expand, and large mission critical workloads.

Experience designing with scalable and highly available distributed systems in the cloud and on-prem
Demonstrated ability to work with customers to review complex architecture of existing applications, providing guidance on how to improve by leveraging technology
Excellent presentation, communication, and interpersonal skills, with the ability to convey complex technical and business concepts in a clear and compelling manner to technology and business leadership.
Ability to strategize with sales teams and provide recommendations on how to drive a multi-threaded account strategy, aligning other MongoDB and ecosystem resources to move towards a mutually beneficial account plan
The ability to travel up to 20%
