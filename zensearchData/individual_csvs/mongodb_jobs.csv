We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhereon premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, its no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.
MongoDB has evolved since starting out as the first truly scalable modern database management system built for internet scale and speed and is now focused on helping global enterprises modernize and transform the architecture of their legacy applications and migrate to a modern database, MongoDB. 
Legacy application modernization is a $4T market, where enterprises, large and small, are trapped with technical debt limiting their ability to make rapid changes to their business processes and leverage new technologies such as GenAI to improve productivity of their employees and serve their customers better than their competitors. 
The Modernization and Transformation group will drive legacy application modernization by leveraging its proprietary software platform, an Agentic AI-based software engineering and software development platform that reduces the amount of time needed to conduct core modernization activities by 10X, and produces better quality software that is future ready, i.e., with the ability to continue to maintain and build GenAI features as the business evolves. 
The Senior Program Director will be responsible for the overall success of the Modernization and Transformation of legacy applications and database program, and will have cross functional experience with ability to manage client expectations across client leadership - C-Suite to Delivery Leads, and internal teams across pre-sales, delivery, delivery excellence, finance, HR, and Operations. Unlike traditional programs at Systems Integrators most problems are solved with people and processes, MongoDB Modernization and Transformation programs are executed using its Agentic AI platform, less reliant on manual efforts for core software development activities, matched with skilled engineers and processes. This provides the candidate with unique opportunities to be at the cutting edge of technology revolution in software development. 
The candidate will have strong technical skills having worked in global technology services organizations driving large scale systems integration engagements that are commercially 
complex (fixed fees, milestone based, outcome or value based pricing terms). Each delivery team is global, spanning various geographies and continuously leveraging our technology platform to differentiate delivery capabilities with productivity and quality. While carrying out the responsibilities, the candidate will foster a culture of collaboration with internal and external stakeholders.
