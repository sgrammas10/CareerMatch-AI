MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency and developer experience in the cloud as well as on premises. Organizations are continuously migrating workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB. 
Such transformations are very time intensive and often risky. Tooling based on generative AI promises to accelerate these transformations in a way never seen before.

Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build anywhereon the edge, on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 developers joining MongoDB every month, its no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.
MongoDB is looking for an outstanding person to join our newly created Field Engineering team and take on a key role in our extended R&amp;D organization. Field Engineering is linking the work of teams engaged on application modernization roles with our Product and Engineering teams.
Many organizations have built up large estates of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, long development times, operating cost, and inability to run on cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernisation programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency and developer experience in the cloud as well as on premises. Organizations are continuously migrating workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB. 
Such transformations are very time intensive and often risky. Tooling based on generative AI promises to accelerate these transformations in a way never seen before. Field Engineering is responsible for exploring the possibilities of Generative AI  technologies and providing invaluable feedback to MongoDBs R&amp;D teams to drive future capabilities of MongoDB and the MongoDB ecosystem.
Application Modernization Field Engineers will work alongside project teams that are executing Application Modernisation projects with customers. The successful candidate will be responsible for evaluation, build, and applying tools in modernization  projects, facilitating the usage of such tools and processes across the different project teams, identifying opportunities for tooling deployment, selecting potential 3rd party tools, contributing to the development of tooling prototypes and helping to shape the product roadmap.
This role can be based remotely in the Europe Region.
Our ideal candidate will have

5+ years of experience as a field engineer or professional services consultant or full stack developer working directly with Enterprise clients
Proficiency in Javascript AND Java or C#, and some familiarity with common database access patterns and frameworks in one or more of these languages
Expert level knowledge about enterprise-scale software architectures, application development methodologies, and software deployment and operations
Deep experience developing enterprise applications using relational databases, and employing SQL and stored procedures with Oracle, MS SQL Server, Sybase and/or PostgreSQL databases
Experience of using and developing with MongoDB and JSON based Document models is highly desirable
Problem solving skills, including the ability to collaborate across disciplines and teams to come up with creative solutions to technical and business challenges
Willingness to dive into a complex domain, ask the right questions, and bring new software tools and technologies to the table to solve customer problems
Great communication skills (both spoken and written), within the team and in customer meetings
Good understanding of Generative AI concepts, tools, and services. Any experience to build new applications/tools using Generative AI is a big plus
And finally, a strong interest in how AI supported toolchains can improve application development
