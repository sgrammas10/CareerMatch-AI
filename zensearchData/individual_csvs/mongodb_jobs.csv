We're looking for a Senior Engineer with a strong background in computer science fundamentals and systems design to join our engineering team. In this role, you will be instrumental in designing, building, and optimizing the underlying data structures, algorithms, and database interactions that power our generative AI platform and code generation tools. This involves crafting sophisticated orchestration layers, robust integration points, and high-performance data systems that seamlessly connect and leverage advanced AI capabilities for code generation. While our immediate focus is on this domain, this role emphasizes strong foundational engineering principles that apply broadly to complex, high-performance systems. Deep prior experience with AI models or machine learning is not a requirement; your strong grasp of core computer science is what matters most, and you'll be given ample time and resources to build expertise in the AI domain. You will work on critical components that ensure the scalability, efficiency, and reliability of our services, collaborating closely with AI researchers and other engineers to translate complex requirements into robust technical solutions.
As a Senior Engineer, you'll be hands-on with design and implementation, while working with engineers across experience levels to build a robust, scalable system. The focus is on performance, correctness, and architectural excellence in a rapidly evolving, data-intensive environment.
Many organizations have built up large estates of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, long development times, operating costs, and inability to run on the cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernization programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency, and developer experience in the cloud and on-premises. Organizations continuously migrate workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB. 
Such transformations are very time-intensive and often risky. MongoDB is bolstering its team by creating tools that guide customers in transitioning their applications from relational databases to MongoDB. As businesses evolve their application development frameworks, they're increasingly drawn to the versatility of the document model. The Application Modernization team, already instrumental in this area, aids developers in making the shift from relational databases to MongoDB via Relational Migrator. Now, they're broadening their toolkit and are keen on modernizing code using a mix of AI and traditional text processing.
What You'll Do

Design, implement, and optimize high-performance data structures and algorithms for core components of our generative AI orchestration platform.
Design and develop efficient data pipelines and storage solutions for AI model integration and output processing.
Collaborate with AI researchers and machine learning engineers to understand data needs.
Identify and address performance bottlenecks and architectural challenges in our systems, particularly within data flow and orchestration.
Contribute to platform features like data versioning, efficient data retrieval, and ensuring data integrity for AI-generated code and related metadata.
Mentor and guide junior and senior engineers on best practices in data structures, algorithms, and database design.
Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and contribute to the overall technical direction of the team.
Work to develop robust and efficient backend services that orchestrate AI functionalities.

Who You Are

5+ years of engineering experience in backend systems, distributed systems, or core platform development.
Deep expertise in data structures and algorithms, with a proven track record of applying them to solve complex problems.
Proficiency in one or several of Java, Rust, C/C++, and/or Python, with a strong understanding of systems-level programming, memory management, and performance tuning.
Experience designing and building highly available, low-latency systems.
Ability to diagnose and troubleshoot complex technical issues in production environments.
Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work effectively in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
Proven ability to collaborate across disciplines and experience levels, from researchers to junior engineers.
Deep understanding of SQL (preferably Oracle), including advanced querying, schema design, and database optimization for performance and scalability.
You have a strong desire to understand complex problem spaces and own solutions.

Nice to Have

Familiarity with cloud-native distributed systems (e.g., Kubernetes, Kafka).
Experience with NoSQL databases and understanding of their trade-offs is great, but not required. We'll teach you NoSQL.
Contributions to relevant open-source projects.
