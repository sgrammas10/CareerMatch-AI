This role requires a deep understanding of Enterprise Advanced, Ops Manager, their backup capabilities and how each interconnects, as well as the ability to lead complex, cross-functional initiatives and engage meaningfully with customers across this entire solution space.

Collaborate intensely with Backup Engineering, Core Database Product &amp; Engineering, customer-facing field teams (Sales, Technical Support, Customer Success, Professional Services), and Product &amp; Engineering teams focused on Enterprise Advanced and Ops Manager to deliver impactful solutions
Translate complex customer requirements and business needs into clear, well-defined product requirements and specifications for backup/restore operations, both through highly automated programmatic management and more manual use
Actively engage with customers to build a profound understanding of their current usage patterns, desired future states, and unmet needs in both the disaster recovery and the broader MongoDB Enterprise Advanced space
Partner with Product Marketing to effectively position and launch new features and drive adoption
Own the success of your product area, defining and monitoring key metrics to ensure business impact and continuously refine the product towards excellence
Drive execution diligently, managing trade-offs, anticipating risks, and ensuring clear, consistent communication with all stakeholders

What You'll Bring (Requirements):

5+ years of product management or equivalent experience, with a significant focus on complex technical, enterprise-grade software products
Proven experience and success in delivering enterprise software products to market, from ideation to launch and iteration
Demonstrable experience working with, or deep understanding of, centralized system management platforms similar to Ops Manager, particularly in relation to ensuring resilience, business continuity and disaster recovery
Solid understanding of the challenges and requirements faced by enterprises in self-hosting software complex systems
Proven ability to translate complex technical concepts and customer needs into clear product strategies and detailed requirements
Experience with products that offer programmatic interfaces (APIs, CLIs, SDKs) for automation and integration
Excellent interpersonal, written, and verbal communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex issues convincingly to both technical and non-technical audiences
A self-starter mentality with a strong bias for action, comfortable navigating ambiguity and driving clarity in a dynamic environment
Strong analytical skills, with experience using data to inform product decisions
Strong understanding of database concepts; MongoDB experience is highly desirable
