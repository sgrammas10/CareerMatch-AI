Rotational Design: 
CSDP Associates are encouraged to diversify their rotations and professional development by pursuing a variety of positions during the two-year program across the four rotation types: Technical, Client-Facing, Operational, and Strategic.

These potential rotations allow the Associate to gain understanding of the technical aspects of the products/ services developed and how to adapt technical concepts to drive business outcomes.
