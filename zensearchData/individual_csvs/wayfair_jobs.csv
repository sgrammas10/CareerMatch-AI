Throughout this customer journey, we are responsible for maintaining an accurate representation of our dynamic supply chain, determining how different products will fit into boxes, predicting how these boxes will flow through warehouses and trucks, and ultimately surfacing the information our customers need to inform their decision and the details our suppliers and carriers require to successfully execute on the promises made to our customers. We do all of this in milliseconds, thousands of times per second.
What Youll Do:

Partner with your business stakeholders to provide them with transparency, data, and resources to make informed decisions

Drive high impact architectural decisions and hands-on development, including inception, design, execution, and delivery following good design and coding practices.

Identify risks and gaps in technical approaches and propose solutions to meet team and project goals.
Create proposals and action plans to garner support across the organization.
