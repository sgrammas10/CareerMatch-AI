Who We Are:
Wayfair runs the largest custom e-commerce large parcel network in the United States, approximately 1.6 million square meters of logistics space. The nature of the network is inherently a highly variable ecosystem that requires flexible, reliable, and resilient systems to operate efficiently. 
 
We are looking for a passionate Backend Software Engineer to join the Fulfillment Optimization team. This team builds the platforms that determine how customer orders are fulfilled, optimizing for Wayfair profitability and customer delight. A big part of our work revolves around enhancing and scaling customer-facing platforms that provide fulfillment information on our websites, starting at the top of the customer funnel on the search pages all the way through orders being delivered. Throughout this customer journey, we are responsible for maintaining an accurate representation of our dynamic supply chain, determining how different products will fit into boxes, predicting how these boxes will flow through warehouses and trucks, and ultimately surfacing the information our customers need to inform their decision and the details our suppliers and carriers require to successfully execute on the promises made to our customers. We do all of this in milliseconds, thousands of times per second.
 
Product Manager, Release Engineering
Wayfairs core platforms are increasingly driven by a cutting edge set of software systems that interact in complex ways to ensure that we are using them to their full potential. Business applications of these systems span many fields including the order lifecycle, supply chain, supplier partnerships, and more! These fields require a sophisticated technology stack that allows for complex systems combined with configurability for rapid testing and exploration.

This person will translate the business and user needs into a pragmatic and iterative strategy and roadmap, along with providing specifications and user stories for the engineering teams. The product manager will serve as the subject matter expert, push for adoption for new use cases, and continually improve our platform capabilities.
 
What Youll Do:

Product Ownership: Serve as the subject matter expert and champion for release engineering, demonstrating a deep understanding of their technology, strengths, weaknesses, and market alternatives.
Strategic Planning: Partner with engineering leaders to develop and maintain a compelling product vision and roadmap, prioritizing feature requests based on business value and impact, and ensuring alignment with stakeholders.
End-to-End Delivery: Take full accountability for the successful delivery of platform enhancements and support, translating product outcomes into actionable engineering stories and tickets.
Adoption and Advocacy: Proactively market your products internally, measuring adoption, addressing gaps, and ensuring all potential users understand the value proposition.
Technical Acumen: Gain a deep understanding of the technologies underpinning your products, enabling you to influence technical pivots when necessary and architect high-level system plans.
Stakeholder Communication: Maintain open and transparent communication with stakeholders, providing regular updates on product progress and ensuring alignment with organizational goals.

We Are a Match Because You Have:

Product Management Experience: 2+ years of experience in product development, preferably with software platforms, demonstrating a proven track record of delivering successful products.
Technical Foundation: 1+ years of foundational understanding of software technologies, ideally with experience in accelerating deployment patterns.
Standards Development: Experience in developing or influencing standards related to access management, asset provisioning, and governance processes.
Data Analysis Skills: Proficiency in SQL, enabling you to extract ad hoc data for analysis and decision-making.

Customer Focus: A passion for creating amazing, customer-centric products, with a focus on measuring their effectiveness and usability through clear KPIs.
Collaboration and Prioritization: Ability to effectively collaborate across multiple stakeholder groups, juggle large initiatives, and prioritize work based on impact.

This high-margin business is one of the biggest opportunities in Wayfairs profitability. 
At Wayfair, Advertising empowers suppliers to boost visibility of their products and brands on our platform.

What Youll Do:

Partner with business, machine learning / applied science, and other technology teams to identify opportunities to expand or optimize our footprint through sponsored product placements.
Write product requirements for the above in collaboration with cross-functional and cross-department teams, including the ad ranking, platform, and advertiser experience teams
Coordinate with stakeholder teams owning Wayfairs website and recommendation algorithms to execute tests and launches of sponsored footprint expansions and optimizations
Work with your own engineering team to drive timely and smooth execution by performing sprint rituals like grooming, planning and retrospective.
Drive go to market for your products in partnership with internal or external stakeholders.
Define the longer-term vision for sponsored product placements, and how + when they should be used vs. other ad or organic content types on the site
Influence our thinking on how we can improve all aspects of the ad serving stack, including candidate generation and ranking, to improve ads monetization outcomes for sponsored product placements
Build and maintain product roadmap along with constantly monitoring the success and measuring the impact of your products/features.

We're A Match Because You Have:

3-5 years building software products at scale with measurable impact and ideally across multiple platforms or workstreams.
Experience with advertising or consumer-facing experiences is preferred. 
Track record of effective partnership with engineering and machine learning / applied science to drive complex cross-org initiatives and product launches
Excellent quantitative skills with demonstrated experience turning data into actionable insights and requirements. Past experience running A/B tests and making sound, data driven decisions is preferred
Familiarity with UI/UX design principles and best practices for a front-end eCommerce experience
Ability to keep up in technical conversations with both software engineers and data scientists
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to distill technical nuances into the so-what and tailor your message to the audience (cross functional stakeholders, senior leadership, etc)
A customer-centric mindset and intuition, with the ability to balance customer value between both sides of a two-sided marketplace (supplier advertisers and Wayfair customers). 
Ability to work with and influence partner teams (Senior Manager +) across various functional areas.
