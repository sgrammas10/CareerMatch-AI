We are looking for a Sales Executive for Real Producers Magazine. Our magazines are mailed directly to the top-producing agents in each market and share personal stories that connect, elevate, and inspire. 
Who we are looking for:
An ideal person for this opportunity is a professional, outgoing person who has an entrepreneurial mindset. 
Though most of the day-to-day for a Sales Executive revolves around sales-related activity, it is far from a traditional sales role. Many of our  Sales Executives, known as Area Directors, do have prior sales experience, but our unique low-pressure sales approach combined with the other aspects of the opportunity mean our most successful people operate more dynamically as business owners. 
Though some sales and business experience is a plus, we provide extensive training and a support system to help all Area Directors be as successful as possible.
Your Day-to-Day:

Meet with local business owners for a low-pressure consultative meeting to determine if a partnership with Real Producers in their market is a mutual fit.
Develop a network within the real estate community through a proven model for engagement.
Plan events aimed at connecting top agents and preferred client partners using the N2 formula.
Meet with realtors to develop relationships and recommendations for potential partners.

What ideal candidates find most attractive:

Control Over Their Schedule  While our Sales Executives have a strong work ethic and are motivated by a sense of purpose in their role, they can flex their hours to optimize their productivity and work-life balance.
Uncapped Potential  Though not every Sales Executive is looking for the highest earning potential, most people take advantage of the commission structure that allows them to grow their income uncapped year after year.
Meaningful Opportunity  Our ideal candidates have many options when changing jobs, yet those most attracted to this role find a sense of purpose in helping local business owners grow their businesses  especially in a time when there's so much noise revolving around advertising and digital marketing. Our Area Directors help simplify things for our partners and stand behind our publications and digital offerings with confidence and integrity.

Our average commission paid to the top Real Producer Area Directors with one publication was more than $352,400* during the 2022-2023 fiscal year.

We are looking for a Sales Executive for Real Producers Magazine. Our magazines are mailed directly to the top-producing agents in each market and share personal stories that connect, elevate, and inspire. 
Who we are looking for:
An ideal person for this opportunity is a professional, outgoing person who has an entrepreneurial mindset. 
Though most of the day-to-day for a Sales Executive revolves around sales-related activity, it is far from a traditional sales role. Many of our  Sales Executives, known as Area Directors, do have prior sales experience, but our unique low-pressure sales approach combined with the other aspects of the opportunity mean our most successful people operate more dynamically as business owners. 
Though some sales and business experience is a plus, we provide extensive training and a support system to help all Area Directors be as successful as possible.
Your Day-to-Day:

Meet with local business owners for a low-pressure consultative meeting to determine if a partnership with Real Producers in their market is a mutual fit.
Develop a network within the real estate community through a proven model for engagement.
Plan events aimed at connecting top agents and preferred client partners using the N2 formula.
Meet with realtors to develop relationships and recommendations for potential partners.

What ideal candidates find most attractive:

Control Over Their Schedule  While our Sales Executives have a strong work ethic and are motivated by a sense of purpose in their role, they can flex their hours to optimize their productivity and work-life balance.
Uncapped Potential  Though not every Sales Executive is looking for the highest earning potential, most people take advantage of the commission structure that allows them to grow their income uncapped year after year.
Meaningful Opportunity  Our ideal candidates have many options when changing jobs, yet those most attracted to this role find a sense of purpose in helping local business owners grow their businesses  especially in a time when there's so much noise revolving around advertising and digital marketing. Our Area Directors help simplify things for our partners and stand behind our publications and digital offerings with confidence and integrity.

Our average commission paid to the top Real Producer Area Directors with one publication was more than $352,400* during the 2022-2023 fiscal year.
