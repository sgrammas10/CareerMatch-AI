Lead &amp; Grow: Hire, mentor, and retain a diverse crew of MLEs and software engineers with a strong product mindset. Foster a culture of rapid iteration, ownership, and inclusion.

Communication Superpowers: Able to distill complex ML trade-offs for executives, product managers, and non-technical stakeholders alike.
