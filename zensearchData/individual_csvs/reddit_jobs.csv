As a company, Reddit primarily generates revenue through advertising, and we're working towards building a massive business to fund our mission. We distinguish ourselves from other digital ad platforms by attracting advertisers who want to connect with a specific target audience because of our passionate and engaged communities.
 
Reddit ads marketplace is a dynamic and complicated environment where millions of engagements among Reddit users, advertisers and the platform occur every second. Its critical for us to extract useful and statistically significant signals from the massive volume of events to guide the product developments and decisions in a scientific way. 
 
The Ads Experimentation Platform (AEXP) team builds tools for our engineers and scientists to accurately test new products and efficiently verify new ideas in the ads marketplace.

An A/B testing framework that split both users and ad budgets to create parallel and mutually exclusive control/treatment sub ads marketplaces,
An exploration tool that can run multiple (hundreds of) A/B testing pairs of campaigns over multiple algorithmic candidates for pacing,
Partitioning the pacing and budgeting systems to accommodate the growing number of advertisers and maintain the refreshing rate above once per minute,

 
As a senior software engineer in the Ads Experimentation Platform team, you will work closely with data science partners and product leaders to improve the capacity and efficiency of existing experimentation tools, research and build new testing methodologies and tools, and lead the experimentation practices across the Ads marketplace teams.
