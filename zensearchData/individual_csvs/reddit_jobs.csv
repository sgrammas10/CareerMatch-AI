About the Role:
As a Machine Learning Engineer on our Audience Intelligence team, you will play a pivotal role in this transformation.

Responsibilities:

Design and develop machine learning models to infer and assess user attributes (e.g. Age, Gender, Language,In-Market status, etc)

Conduct and analyze offline and online experiments to validate the impact of new intelligence features on Targeting Products and downstream parts of the serving ecosystem.
Partner closely with software engineers to deploy your models and ensure the intelligence they produce is successfully integrated into our real-time user profiles.
