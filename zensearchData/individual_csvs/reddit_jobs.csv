What youll do:

Lead &amp; Grow: Hire, mentor, and retain a diverse crew of MLEs and software engineers with a strong product mindset. Foster a culture of rapid iteration, ownership, and inclusion.
Set Vision: Work with product to define long term roadmaps that aligns generative AI bets with Ads OKRs. Translate fuzzy ideas into concrete milestones, measurable outcomes, and define technical steps that answer how do we best build this?.
Ship Products: Launch and scale LLM/VLM-powered generators (images, video, text) and predictive models (creative quality scores, brand-lift). Own the full lifecycle from prototype to production.
Build Systems: Architect low-latency generation/serving stacks and petabyte-scale feature pipelines that meet privacy, safety, and compliance requirements.

Communication Superpowers: Able to distill complex ML trade-offs for executives, product managers, and non-technical stakeholders alike.
