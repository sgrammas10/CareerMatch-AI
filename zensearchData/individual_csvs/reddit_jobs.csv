Reddit has a flexible-first workforce!
The Ads Targeting team's mission is to develop robust, scalable, and privacy-compliant targeting products that enable advertisers to effectively reach relevant users. We are evolving to become the Audience Intelligence Engine, the central nervous system for user understanding in Reddit's advertising ecosystem. Our goal is to synthesize a multitude of signals into unified, real-time, and privacy-compliant user profiles that power everything from targeting and ranking to forecasting and insights
About the Role:
As a Machine Learning Engineer on our Audience Intelligence team, you will play a pivotal role in this transformation. You will be responsible for designing and developing the machine learning models that generate new user intelligence at scale. This is a highly collaborative role where you will focus on modeling excellence and partner tightly with the team's software engineers to integrate your model-produced intelligence into the broader advertising ecosystem. Your work will directly enhance our ability to understand users and improve advertiser outcomes.
Responsibilities:

Design and develop machine learning models to infer and assess user attributes (e.g. Age, Gender, Language,In-Market status, etc)
Utilize diverse signals  including on-platform behavior (1P), off-platform partner data (3P), and contextual cues  to create predictive features for your models.
Conduct and analyze offline and online experiments to validate the impact of new intelligence features on Targeting Products and downstream parts of the serving ecosystem.
Partner closely with software engineers to deploy your models and ensure the intelligence they produce is successfully integrated into our real-time user profiles.
Collaborate with the Ads Privacy team to ensure all models and data handling practices are secure and compliant with policies like GDPR, CCPA, and ATT.

What We're Looking For:

2+ years of experience with applied machine learning models
Proficiency in programming languages (Python, SQL) and statistical analysis
A pragmatic, product-oriented mindset focused on building and shipping ML systems that deliver measurable business impact.
Effective communication skills to collaborate with diverse teams and stakeholders
Passion for empowering communities and advertisers through innovative ML solutions

Familiarity with advertising technology (ad tech) concepts and metrics.
Experience building models for inference on user behavior or characteristics.
Experience with deep learning, representation learning, or transfer learning
Familiarity with MLOps tools and ML experimentation workflows

Why Join Us:

This is a rare opportunity to build a critical intelligence system from the ground up. Unlike mature organizations making incremental changes to legacy systems, you will be a key part of a small, focused team building the Audience Intelligence Engine from 0 to 1. Your work will have a foundational impact on the future of Reddit's advertising business
Collaborate with a diverse and talented team of engineers, researchers, and marketers
Develop your skills in machine learning, deep learning, and large-scale system design
