As a company, Reddit primarily generates revenue through advertising, and we're working towards building a massive business to fund our mission. We distinguish ourselves from other digital ad platforms by attracting advertisers who want to connect with a specific target audience because of our passionate and engaged communities.
 
Reddit ads marketplace is a dynamic and complicated environment where millions of engagements among Reddit users, advertisers and the platform occur every second. Its critical for us to extract useful and statistically significant signals from the massive volume of events to guide the product developments and decisions in a scientific way. 
 
The Ads Experimentation Platform (AEXP) team builds tools for our engineers and scientists to accurately test new products and efficiently verify new ideas in the ads marketplace. Have you heard about Budget Cannibalization? Have you wondered why a user-split A/B testing is insufficient in testing products in the Ads marketplace? How can we make the most out of rare and sparse samples (e.g. conversion events)? How can I explore 100 algorithmic candidates at the same time? These are the typical problems we are dealing with on a daily basis.
 
Meanwhile, Ads Pacing plays a crucial role in both supporting the dynamism of the marketplace and accommodating the budget-aware A/B experiments, therefore our team is also committed to building scalable and flexible pacing infrastructures that improves the market efficiency and budget-aware testing capacity.

An A/B testing framework that split both users and ad budgets to create parallel and mutually exclusive control/treatment sub ads marketplaces,
An exploration tool that can run multiple (hundreds of) A/B testing pairs of campaigns over multiple algorithmic candidates for pacing,
Partitioning the pacing and budgeting systems to accommodate the growing number of advertisers and maintain the refreshing rate above once per minute,

 
As a senior software engineer in the Ads Experimentation Platform team, you will work closely with data science partners and product leaders to improve the capacity and efficiency of existing experimentation tools, research and build new testing methodologies and tools, and lead the experimentation practices across the Ads marketplace teams.

Building A/B testing tools for measuring infra cost by each ad product,
Building advertiser-facing tools for exploring through Reddit Ads products and optimizing for the best performances,

Who You Might Be:

Degree in a quantitative discipline: engineering, statistics, operations research, computer science, informatics, applied mathematics, economics, etc.

The Deployment Infrastructure team is looking to hire a Senior Software Engineer with a focus on creating robust, automated, deployment systems that balance reliability and efficiency.
At Reddit, we aim to deploy our services globally. This involves taking release artifacts and ensuring they can be deployed via custom workflows across a variety of compute clusters. We aim to ensure that bad deployments can be automatically detected, rolled back, and minimize impact on our production systems. At the same time, we need to ensure successful deployments can propagate across our infrastructure without human intervention.
Many companies achieve with operations teams that can write scripts and build pipelines. However, at Reddit, our scale and developers demand that we build our own software and integrate capable open-source tooling. This means we are looking for individuals with a strong software engineering background to fill this role.
In your day-to-day, you can expect to:

Work collaboratively with a team of software engineers build and deploy software capable of:

Orchestrating complex deployment workflows
Progressively rolling out services globally
Achieving automated rollback of failed deployments
Providing insight and monitoring around the health of deployments

Work with our end-users to establish requirements and designs.
Integrate open source technologies, largely in the CNCF ecosystem and at times contribute to them to help meet Reddits business needs.
Build end user tooling, for example CLI utilities in Go that help interact with dashboards.
Share on-call responsibilities with the deployment infrastructure team.

You have:

5+ years of experience working in the infrastructure and/or deployment domain. Specifically with a focus on software engineering (as opposed to systems operations)

Language proficiency in either Go (Preferred), Rust, or Python.

Experience developing on top of Kubernetes or similar distributed systems.
Experience utilizing systems in the continuous delivery domain such as Argo, Flux, Temporal, and similar systems.
Strong troubleshooting competency ranging from higher-level orchestration concerns to lower-level runtime ones.
Experience designing large systems, scoping work, and building consensus with other engineers.
Excellent communication skills to collaborate with a service-oriented team and company.
