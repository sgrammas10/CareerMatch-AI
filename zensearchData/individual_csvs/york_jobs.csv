BOROUGH OFFICES:
Manhattan is home to over 1.6 million residents and serves as the economic engine of the regional economy with well over 2 million workers commuting to and within the borough daily. The landscape of Manhattan is highly varied and ranges from very high-density office and residential districts to low scale rowhouses, stretching the full 13.4 miles of the island. The borough includes the sources of some of the most iconic images of the global imagination  Times Square, Wall Street, Central Park, Harlem, the United Nations  as well as countless hidden gems around every corner.

The Manhattan Borough Office, located in the Department of City Plannings headquarters building in the heart of Manhattans Financial District, is responsible for developing borough-wide and local area plans, reviewing and processing land use applications pursuant to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP), and providing technical and policy guidance and direction on all land use and zoning related matters to the City Planning Commission, local Community Boards, elected officials and the public at large. The Manhattan Office emphasizes planning and urban design that create a more equitable city, with rich opportunities for and access to housing, employment, recreation, and transit.
