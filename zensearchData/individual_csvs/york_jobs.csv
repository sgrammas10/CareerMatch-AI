To support this important work, the administration has committed $5 billion in new capital funding, bringing the 10-year planned investment in housing to $22 billion the largest in the citys history. This investment, coupled with a commitment to reduce administrative and regulatory barriers, is a multi-pronged strategy to tackle New York Citys complex housing crisis, by addressing homelessness and housing instability, promoting economic stability and mobility, increasing homeownership opportunities, improving health and safety, and increasing opportunities for equitable growth.Your Team:The Office of Enforcement and Neighborhood Services (OENS) leads the agencys effort to work closely with other HPD divisions and outside community partners to identify buildings in distress, assess and develop appropriate strategies to address those properties and work closely with responsible owners to develop a plan to improve conditions and return buildings to firm financial footing and physical health. OENS uses enforcement tools within its Division of Code Enforcement, Housing Litigation Division, Emergency Operations and Enhanced Enforcement, and the Division of Neighborhood Preservation to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory obligations.The Office of Enforcement of Neighborhood Services is composed of six divisions: Data Management &amp; Technology (DMT), Division of Neighborhood Preservation (DNP), Administration &amp; Internal Compliance (AIC), Housing Litigation Division (HLD), Division of Code Enforcement (DCE), and Emergency Operations and Enhanced Enforcement Division (EOD).  Your Impact:The Emergency Operations and Enhanced Enforcement Division (EOD) Alternative Enforcement Program (AEP) is an enforcement program which identifies the 250 most distressed multiple dwellings citywide each year.  AEP allows the city to make repairs to these buildings and bill the landlord for the repairs. This keeps residents in the direst of conditions from waiting for landlords to act.The AEP staff perform roof to cellar inspections, determine the underlying cause of the violations and order the owner to perform system replacement work.  When an owner fails to perform the ordered system replacement work, AEP may perform the work and bill the landlord for the cost.  Your Role:This new need is based on several factors that have compounded over time to require an increase in staffing, including legislative changes affecting the size of the buildings and the number of buildings selected per year/round. In the beginning of January 2024 the 250 buildings selected resulted in a significant increase in the number of units, increasing almost by about 50%, from an average of 5,000 units to over 7,500 units. As of August 1, 2024, AEP has 759 buildings active in the program for which the following tasks are required. As a Community Coordinator, your role will include, but not be limited to the following: Your Responsibilities:-	Working closely with a team consisting of a Housing Inspector and a Construction Project Manager;-	Planning, coordinating, and monitoring field work assignments;-	Compiling, and recording data for participating buildings;-	Preparing, posting, mailing, and tracking all AEP notices and correspondence;-	Contacting owners and tenants in participating AEP buildings to schedule inspections, and resolving access issues;-	Researching owner registration and emergency repair information;-	Monitoring all complaints and violations for buildings participating in AEP;-	Processing AEP Dismissal Request Inspection applications;-	Promptly and accurately responding to inquiries from the public;-	Performing field visits to buildings in caseload to gather data, post notices, and resolve access issues;-	Assisting with monitoring compliance with AEP mandates;-	Conducting and attending meetings pertaining to AEP issues as requested.Preferred skills: -	Candidates must possess excellent written and verbal communications skills-	Candidates must be proficient with PC software applications, such as Excel and Microsoft Word-	Candidates with bi-lingual skillsNote: Candidates may be assigned to any office within the 5 boroughs and may be assigned to work evenings and weekends.COMMUNITY COORDINATOR - 560581.
