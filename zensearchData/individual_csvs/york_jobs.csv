Specifically, CWO manages three dozen training programs, in such areas as tech, health care, and construction, that are offered in collaboration with higher education institutions (including the City University of New York) and non-profit training providers. The Division also oversees a network of 18 Workforce1 (WF1) career centers, operated in all five boroughs by workforce development providers under contract with SBS.

Eligible jobseekers enroll in SBS training programs at no cost to them and can also visit WF1 centers to take advantage of career services such as interviewing workshops or direct connections to employment opportunities across NYC. The second constituency is employers. Working with a variety of internal and external partners, CWO works to identify employers who might benefit from hiring graduates of our training programs as well as those who might benefit from targeted recruitment services offered through the WF1 centers that enable employers to find qualified candidates for a variety of positions.

These models include but are not limited to: training programs that are funded and/or managed by external partners; training programs that are offered in online, hybrid, and asynchronous formats; and shorter-term workshops/classes that offer certifications in very specific skills/areas. -	Oversee SBS training stipend program, which provides stipends to certain training program participants. Ensure that stipends are distributed in a timely manner that complies with all applicable rules and regulations. -	Promote awareness about, and referrals to, CWOs training programs.
