The Early Intervention Program (EIP) is a comprehensive interagency program that supports infants and children with developmental delays in their efforts to realize their full potential. It reduces the likelihood of delays among at-risk children, assists and empowers families to meet their child's and their own needs, and entitles children, regardless of race, ethnicity or income to services through the program. Research demonstrates that children who receive Early Intervention services are less likely to need special education, or if they do, are able to be in less restrictive settings; they also have higher math and English scores in third grade, and more positive life outcomes. Thus, receipt of Early Intervention services benefits the child, their family, and society, including saving money on the intensive special education and services that are not needed.
