The scope of work encompasses a full design cycle, including conceptualization, design, analysis, manufacturing and testing for primary and secondary structures related to Thrust Structure, Propellant Tanks, Interstage or Fairing, to name a few. You will need to think creatively and leverage innovation to reduce mass, parts, processes and tooling required.
Your responsibilities will include, but not be limited to the following:

Innovative conceptualization of structural load path, design for complex structures and adjacent system packaging
Review of static &amp; dynamic load inputs, material properties &amp; test as well as structural systems &amp; subsystems requirements
Analysis and sizing of flight structures to ensure timely design reviews and drawing release
Develop and support hardware test campaigns, including test integration, operation and result evaluation
Support manufacturing process development

In order to be successful in this role, you must be someone who is self-motivated, adaptable and is able to lead your own projects to completion in a fast-paced environment. Ideally, you have significant mechanical or structural design experience and a proven track record completing collaborative projects effectively.
On a weekly basis, you will be designing flight components for our upcoming Terran R vehicle using NX/TeamCenter, performing analysis using Nastran, ANSYS and/or hand calculations, creating and releasing drawings as well as supporting fabrication of your components. You will own your design from requirements to production. You will also use your strong organizational skills to properly document your work and present your recommendations when decisions are needed.

The Mechanisms Manufacturing team is responsible for working alongside the vehicle design and test teams to develop hardware that enables Terran R reusability, such as landing legs, pneumatic separation and release mechanisms, and linear and rotary electromechanical actuators.  In this role, you will advocate for scalable manufacturing in product design trades and reviews, ensuring that manufacturing considerations are integrated early in the design process. You will develop build flow planning, large-scale part logistics, tooling design, conceptualizing &amp; sourcing, analyze build &amp; test data, work center capacity modelling and complex assembly work planning and execution. To be successful in this role, you need to be a self-starter that can thrive in ambiguity, identify problems and quickly resolve them, and provide definition to the previously undefined. You should have a commitment to quality and the discipline required to achieve it.

Responsible for a major mechanized subassembly and its child components from design release through test and successful integration onto the Terran R launch vehiclelay out the build and test flow to ensure an efficient, high-quality product flow capable of scaling with time. 
Drive the assemblys build and test effort through design integration, part sourcing, assembly sequencing, mBOM development, build and test work order creation, and specification authoring. 
Support work center development by considering assembly and test operations, safety, tooling and capital equipment requirements, and company operational goals.
Provide hands-on support to the shop floor and production personnel, promptly addressing any issues that arise and offering upstream feedback to drive design for manufacturability.
Foster strong collaborative relationships with design, production, supply chain and quality assurance, facilitating effective communication and coordination to ensure alignment with company objectives and successful execution of manufacturing processes.
Foster a culture of critical thinking and imaginative problem-solving, constantly challenging the established norms in engineering and manufacturing, and pushing the boundaries to achieve efficient production. 

About You:

BS degree in aerospace, mechanical, or manufacturing engineering (or technical equivalent) with 3+ years of experience building and testing hardware in a manufacturing environment
Extensive experience authoring work instructions and/or test procedures to build and validate interdisciplinary mechanical and electrical assemblies
Experience partnering with design engineering, manufacturing, and production personnel
Extensive experience managing and implementing large process and/or quality improvements with large scope of ownership
Experience developing or participating in developing tooling as a manufacturing representative
Experience with at least 2 of the following:

Machining, precision drilling, mechanical fastening, and torqueing operations, electromechanical assembly, electrical or pneumatic functional checkouts, integrated testing, tool design and fab, subassembly work center development



Nice to haves but not required:  

Self-starter that has demonstrated the ability to define and own a process from scratch and roll out that process through adept communication to a diverse team
New product introduction of an aerospace hardware system into a manufacturing, test, and production system with proven success
Working knowledge of rocket subsystems including structures, mechanisms, high pressure gas systems, and/or avionics
Strong understanding GD&amp;T and drafting principles

This journey begins right here on Earth  where we design, build, and fly rockets to deliver customer payloads to orbit. Terran R, our medium-to-heavy lift reusable rocket, fulfills the growing demand for launch capacity, thanks to our iterative approach that accelerates design, testing, and development while minimizing costs. While our groundbreaking research and development in 3D printing pushes the boundaries of large-scale additive manufacturing.
Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals. Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team: 
The Manufacturing team owns all process development, fabrication strategy, and production equipment for Terran R, our next generation, reusable rocket. This team has a wide variety of responsibilities  from factory floor layout, to developing complex tooling for novel processes, and interfacing with our vehicle engineering team to heavily influence design of the rocket.
