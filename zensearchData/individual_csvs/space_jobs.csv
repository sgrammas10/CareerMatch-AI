Most test roles also involve systems work  on this side of your role, you may support engine subsystem troubleshooting, partner team product investigations, engine system analysis and simulation, trade studies, and more.
You will also take ownership of projects of your creation to increase our collective efficiency.
As our vehicle development program progresses, you may have the opportunity to be involved in stage test and flight campaigns  including sitting console for launch operations, defining stage test objectives, and defining flight concepts of operations (CONOPS).

In order to be successful in this role, you should be a self-starter who is capable of leading collaborative projects to completion. You should be always looking for ways to improve yourself &amp; learn more about the systems that interface with yours  who will leverage the training &amp; mentorship we provide to grow as an engineer and an individual. Along with these high expectations comes the opportunity to have a significant influence on a fast-growing startup company and to make rapid professional gains in an environment that encourages growth and risk.
