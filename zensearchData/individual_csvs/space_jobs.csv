Engineers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of their parts, from initial design through production to qualification and flight. The team fosters a culture of bottoms-up decision-making, free from technical gatekeeping, where ownership and accountability are key at all levels. But designing engines with a quarter million pounds of thrust is just the beginning. As the flight configuration enters qualification, the team is now exploring modifications for future engines, including thrust upgrades, new cycles, and design for mass production.
About the Role: 
This role is on the Engine Systems &amp; Test Team. Our work spans simulation &amp; software tools; system-level architecture, requirements, and interfaces; component &amp; integrated system hotfire testing; and more. We collaborate closely with component engineers, our manufacturing team, our Stennis test team, and our Cape launch team to deliver engines that will successfully propel the Terran rocket to orbit. We strive for continuous improvement and support the development of our technical hardware and human teammates alike.  
We are hiring for two test sub-teams: your role will be on either the combustion devices test team (which primarily tests combustion devices like igniters, gas generators, and thrust chambers), or the integrated engine test team (which tests the full engine assembly). Within each team, your work may span several different areas depending on your skillset and the teams needs at the time.

In the test part of your role, you will serve as a Responsible Engineer for propulsion test articles.

You will develop test plans in collaboration with product owners, and you will execute test campaigns with our Stennis team, troubleshooting technical puzzles along the way.
You will own the exploratory operation of new and existing test article designs, diving deep into the evaluation of test hardware behavior in support of continuous engine development and certification.
This role is extremely varied day-to-day and, in addition to overall campaign ownership, can include writing test sequences, reviewing data, hands-on work with test articles, writing code, sitting console for hotfire tests, designing tooling, and more.


Most test roles also involve systems work  on this side of your role, you may support engine subsystem troubleshooting, partner team product investigations, engine system analysis and simulation, trade studies, and more.
You will also take ownership of projects of your creation to increase our collective efficiency.
As our vehicle development program progresses, you may have the opportunity to be involved in stage test and flight campaigns  including sitting console for launch operations, defining stage test objectives, and defining flight concepts of operations (CONOPS).

In order to be successful in this role, you should be a self-starter who is capable of leading collaborative projects to completion. You should be always looking for ways to improve yourself &amp; learn more about the systems that interface with yours  who will leverage the training &amp; mentorship we provide to grow as an engineer and an individual. Along with these high expectations comes the opportunity to have a significant influence on a fast-growing startup company and to make rapid professional gains in an environment that encourages growth and risk.

Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:  
The Propulsion team at Relativity is focused on developing and delivering highly performant and manufacturable engines for Terran R. Engineers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of their parts, from initial design through production to qualification and flight. The team fosters a culture of bottoms-up decision-making, free from technical gatekeeping, where ownership and accountability are key at all levels. But designing engines with a quarter million pounds of thrust is just the beginning. As the flight configuration enters qualification, the team is now exploring modifications for future engines, including thrust upgrades, new cycles, and design for mass production.
About the Role: 
This role is on the Engine Systems &amp; Test Team. Our work spans simulation &amp; software tools; system-level architecture, requirements, and interfaces; component &amp; integrated system hotfire testing; and more. We collaborate closely with component engineers, our manufacturing team, our Stennis test team, and our Cape launch team to deliver engines that will successfully propel the Terran rocket to orbit. We strive for continuous improvement and support the development of our technical hardware and human teammates alike.  
We are hiring for two test sub-teams: your role will be on either the combustion devices test team (which primarily tests combustion devices like igniters, gas generators, and thrust chambers), or the integrated engine test team (which tests the full engine assembly). Within each team, your work may span several different areas depending on your skillset and the teams needs at the time.

In the test part of your role, you will serve as a Responsible Engineer for propulsion test articles.

You will develop test plans in collaboration with product owners, and you will execute test campaigns with our Stennis team, troubleshooting technical puzzles along the way.
You will own the exploratory operation of new and existing test article designs, diving deep into the evaluation of test hardware behavior in support of continuous engine development and certification.
This role is extremely varied day-to-day and, in addition to overall campaign ownership, can include writing test sequences, reviewing data, hands-on work with test articles, writing code, sitting console for hotfire tests, designing tooling, and more.


Most test roles also involve systems work  on this side of your role, you may support engine subsystem troubleshooting, partner team product investigations, engine system analysis and simulation, trade studies, and more.
You will also take ownership of projects of your creation to increase our collective efficiency.
As our vehicle development program progresses, you may have the opportunity to be involved in stage test and flight campaigns  including sitting console for launch operations, defining stage test objectives, and defining flight concepts of operations (CONOPS).

In order to be successful in this role, you should be a self-starter who is capable of leading collaborative projects to completion. You should be always looking for ways to improve yourself &amp; learn more about the systems that interface with yours  who will leverage the training &amp; mentorship we provide to grow as an engineer and an individual. Along with these high expectations comes the opportunity to have a significant influence on a fast-growing startup company and to make rapid professional gains in an environment that encourages growth and risk.
