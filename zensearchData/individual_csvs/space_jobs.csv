Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity andtechnical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team: 
The Propulsion team at Relativity is focused on developing and delivering highly performant and manufacturable engines for Terran R. Engineers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of their parts, from initial design through production to qualification and flight. The team fosters a culture of bottoms-up decision-making, free from technical gatekeeping, where ownership and accountability are key at all levels. But designing engines with a quarter million pounds of thrust is just the beginning. As the flight configuration enters qualification, the team is now exploring modifications for future engines, including thrust upgrades, new cycles, and design for mass production
About the Role:

In the test part of your role, you will serve as a Responsible Engineer for propulsion test articles. These will primarily be combustion devices but may also include valves, heat exchangers, or other components.


You will develop test plans in collaboration with product owners, and you will execute test campaigns with our Stennis team, troubleshooting technical puzzles along the way.
You will own the exploratory operation of new and existing test article designs, diving deep into the evaluation of test hardware behavior in support of continuous engine development and certification.
This role is extremely varied day-to-day and, in addition to overall campaign ownership, can include writing test sequences, reviewing data, hands-on work with test articles, writing code, sitting console for hotfire tests, designing tooling, and more.


Most test roles also involve systems work  on this side of your role, you may support engine subsystem troubleshooting, partner team product investigations, engine or component analysis and simulation, trade studies, and more.
As our vehicle development program progresses, you may have the opportunity to be involved in stage test and flight campaigns.
You will take ownership of projects of your creation to increase our collective efficiency.

You will also lead a small team of engineers with similar responsibilities as the above. This will require mentorship, project management, establishing priorities, communicating with leadership, providing technical guidance, and recruiting. Leaders at Relativity are expected to be both people leaders &amp; highly technical  you will balance your time between effectively supporting your teams growth and success at Relativity and making direct technical contributions of your own. You will serve as a mentor to guide the team and will also learn from peers &amp; mentors of your own within propulsion &amp; the broader company. And in addition to learning from each other, we all learn from the engine  Aeon R is a novel engine thats never been built before, and with every test it gives us new mysteries to solve and challenges to grow from.
In order to be successful in this role, you should be capable of leading collaborative projects to completion with minimal oversight. You should also be a self-starter who is always looking for ways to improve yourself &amp; learn more about the systems that interface with yours. Along with these high expectations comes the opportunity to have a significant influence on a fast-growing startup company and to make rapid professional gains in an environment that encourages growth and risk.

At Relativity Space, we're entering an exciting new chapter under the leadership of Eric Schmidt, focusing on pioneering advancements in aerospace technology. Guided by a vision to redefine space exploration, our team is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
Within this mission, the Data Analysis Platform group plays a critical role. As part of the broader Factory Platform team, this group develops the software systems that empower engineers to quickly analyze test data, understand complex hardware performance metrics, and iterate faster on vehicle designs. By building intuitive, reliable, and scalable tools, we turn raw data into actionable insights helping to accelerate our development timelines and enhance the reliability of our rockets.
As we build the next great commercial launch company and lead in additive manufacturing innovation, we are investing heavily in technologies that enable intelligent, scalable, and automated production. Join us as we embark on groundbreaking projects in 3D printing and AI-driven manufacturing, all spearheaded by our new CEO, Eric Schmidt.
If you are passionate about building platforms that sit at the intersection of software, data, and hardware innovation, this is the team for you.
About the Role:
You'll build the analytical backbone for rocket development - interactive data exploration tools, automated test analysis systems, and decision-making engines that turn raw telemetry into actionable engineering insights. The goal is turning weeks of manual data review into automated go/no-go decisions.
Day-to-day: Build interactive React applications for engineers to explore time-series data, compare test families, and identify performance trends. Work directly with GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control) engineers to create specialized analysis tools for flight dynamics and control system validation. Implement automated decision algorithms that flag anomalies, generate test reports, and accelerate our test cadence from days to hours. Design APIs that surface insights from our existing data platform to power analysis workflows.
The challenge: Building analytical tools that engineers actually want to use. Interactive visualizations that handle terabytes of telemetry, automated analysis systems that make reliable go/no-go decisions, and creating family data analysis workflows that help engineers understand hardware behavior across hundreds of test runs.
