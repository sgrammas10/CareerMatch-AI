The Systems Engineering team ensures that Terran R comes together as a cohesive, high-performing, and scalable system. Within the department, one team focuses on building tools and processes to manage requirements, track decisions, and identify and mitigate risk - enabling faster, more informed development across the program. Engineers work across domains to understand complex problems, identify solutions, and implement them  all with deep technical knowledge, not just documentation. The other team focuses on the vehicle itself, working across teams to ensure all subsystems of Terran R function together as intended, burning down technical risk, and driving informed decisions at every stage of the vehicle lifecycle. Engineers are empowered to lead high-impact efforts, from major test campaigns to console operations during launch, and are trusted to drive improvements across fluids, structures, avionics, and more. Regardless of which team youre on, youll be part of a high-visibility, high-impact department at a pivotal moment in the program, where decisions made today on trades, architecture, and process will shape not just the first launch, but the long-term trajectory of Relativity.
About the Role: 
As an Engineer II Systems Engineer you will collaborate with team members across the organization helping responsible engineers leverage already existing processed and tools, while contributing to the development of new engineering processes and tools to enable the design, development, certification, and flight of the Terran R launch system.
Example projects and responsibilities include the following:

Working with Responsible Engineers ensuring processes are effective and updating content to reflect actual progress as needed
Creating automations in Jira and python to streamline existing processes
Collaborate with Technical Project Managers ensuring design scope is accurately captured in our various tools
Communicating with program leadership on the status of design
Brainstorming ways to improve our current processes and then implementing those ideas
Prototype, implement, and rollout processes, tools, and automation that enable better design and test collaboration across the company

To be successful in this role, you should be self-motivated, adaptable, and able to contribute significantly to a fast-paced integrated vehicle program.

Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:  
The Systems Engineering team ensures that Terran R comes together as a cohesive, high-performing, and scalable system. Within the department, one team focuses on building tools and processes to manage requirements, track decisions, and identify and mitigate risk - enabling faster, more informed development across the program. Engineers work across domains to understand complex problems, identify solutions, and implement them  all with deep technical knowledge, not just documentation. The other team focuses on the vehicle itself, working across teams to ensure all subsystems of Terran R function together as intended, burning down technical risk, and driving informed decisions at every stage of the vehicle lifecycle. Engineers are empowered to lead high-impact efforts, from major test campaigns to console operations during launch, and are trusted to drive improvements across fluids, structures, avionics, and more. Regardless of which team youre on, youll be part of a high-visibility, high-impact department at a pivotal moment in the program, where decisions made today on trades, architecture, and process will shape not just the first launch, but the long-term trajectory of Relativity.
About the Role: 
As an Engineer II Systems Engineer you will collaborate with team members across the organization helping responsible engineers leverage already existing processed and tools, while contributing to the development of new engineering processes and tools to enable the design, development, certification, and flight of the Terran R launch system.
Example projects and responsibilities include the following:

Working with Responsible Engineers ensuring processes are effective and updating content to reflect actual progress as needed
Creating automations in Jira and python to streamline existing processes
Collaborate with Technical Project Managers ensuring design scope is accurately captured in our various tools
Communicating with program leadership on the status of design
Brainstorming ways to improve our current processes and then implementing those ideas
Prototype, implement, and rollout processes, tools, and automation that enable better design and test collaboration across the company

To be successful in this role, you should be self-motivated, adaptable, and able to contribute significantly to a fast-paced integrated vehicle program. You should also be able to resolve ambiguity and drive projects to completion. Ideally, you have Systems Engineering, Process development, Verification and Validation (V&amp;V), and Requirement Management experience, as well as a proven track record completing projects successfully in a highly collaborative environment.

Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team: 
The Propulsion team at Relativity is responsible for the successful development of the engines that will power the Terran R vehicle. We own their design from concept through to launch and reuse. Our team partners heavily with Manufacturing, Test, Launch, and Integration teams, striving to develop our engines in record time and to support Terran R's first launch in 2026. As part of this team, you will help build, test, and iterate on the full product lifecycle of our Aeon-R engine systems, seeing them mature and eventually bring Terran R into space.
About the Role:
You will be responsible for the overall layout, design, analysis, and build of hardware for our Aeon-R propulsion systems. You will work closely with other propulsion teams, the vehicle team, manufacturing/integration teams, and test teams to design, analyze, and optimize. Designs will be informed by both fluid and structural analytical and computational models. Engine assembly level layouts and trades will be weighed against weight, cost, lead time, and part count. To be successful in this role, you should be someone who thrives in ambiguity and is able to lead their own projects to completion.
 
About You:

Bachelor's degree in an engineering field
Experience with computer aided design (CAD) software
Experience with mechanical design
2+ years of experience with engine design
Experience applying fluid, thermal, and structural fundamentals

Nice to haves, but not required:


Experience with Siemens NX and Teamcenter, specifically
Experience with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and commercial tools such as Ansys, Abaqus, or Nastran
Experience with large CAD model management, change management, and configuration management
Experience in the design of liquid propulsion components and systems
