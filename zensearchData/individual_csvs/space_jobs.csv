Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team: 
The additive technology team leads research and development of Relativitys Stargate 3D-printing platform and factory operating system to produce large-scale metal structures for the industrial base. The team works with robotics engineers, data scientists, systems engineers, and welders to advance Relativitys innovative tech stack, which leverages autonomy, advanced simulation, machine learning, and robotics. Working at the intersection of hardware and software, the team is creating a unified platform that can perform additive manufacturing, in-situ monitoring, NDE, and subtraction capabilities in a single print cell. Progressing in parallel to Terran R development, Relativitys breakthroughs in large-scale additive manufacturing have the potential to revolutionize the defense industrial base. 
About the Role:
The Robotics Team at Relativity Space is responsible for building and refining the hardware that powers our autonomous systems. From advanced robotics for manufacturing and additive processes to specialized robots that support development and deployment, our R&amp;D hardware engineers work in close collaboration with software, automation to develop cutting-edge technologies that push the boundaries of space exploration and industrial manufacturing. As a key member of the team, youll bring your hardware expertise to revolutionize the way robotics cooperate and additively manufacture here on earth and off planet.

Focus on thermal management: Take the lead in integrating and optimizing thermal cameras and pyrometers to measure and monitor the temperature of various metals during the manufacturing process, with a strong emphasis on interpass temperature during welding or additive manufacturing
Temperature measurement for welding and additive manufacturing: Develop strategies and solutions to capture the temperature profile of materials during welding, particularly between passes in multi-pass processes (interpass temperature), ensuring optimal material properties and preventing defects in final products
Sensor calibration and validation: Calibrate and validate thermal sensors, including pyrometers and thermal cameras, to ensure high-precision measurements and to maintain accuracy across different metals, processes, and environmental conditions
Data processing and interpretation: Develop algorithms for processing thermal data to calculate critical thermal properties, including temperature gradients and heat transfer rates during welding or additive manufacturing. This will involve post-processing data to interpret the results and adapt the process in real-time
Collaboration with other teams: Work closely with the robotics, welding, additive manufacturing, and materials science teams to ensure that temperature data is accurately integrated into larger process workflows and that changes are made based on thermal feedback
Maintain quality control: Design processes to ensure consistent interpass temperature management and prevent temperature-induced defects during multi-pass welding or additive manufacturing
Research and development: Lead R&amp;D initiatives to explore new technologies, sensors, or approaches to enhance thermal management, and optimize metalworking processes by ensuring accurate temperature measurements and adaptive control
Documentation and reporting: Maintain thorough documentation of calibration, testing, and performance of thermal systems, ensuring all measurements are traceable, repeatable, and meet industry standards

Both contribute to our long-term vision of creating humanitys industrial base on Mars, paving the way for interplanetary life to expand the possibilities of the human experience. This journey begins right here on Earth  where we design, build, and fly rockets to deliver customer payloads to orbit. Terran R, our medium-to-heavy lift reusable rocket, fulfills the growing demand for launch capacity, thanks to our iterative approach that accelerates design, testing, and development while minimizing costs. While our groundbreaking research and development in 3D printing pushes the boundaries of large-scale additive manufacturing.
Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals. Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.
