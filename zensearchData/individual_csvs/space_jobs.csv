Both contribute to our long-term vision of creating humanitys industrial base on Mars, paving the way for interplanetary life to expand the possibilities of the human experience. This journey begins right here on Earth  where we design, build, and fly rockets to deliver customer payloads to orbit. Terran R, our medium-to-heavy lift reusable rocket, fulfills the growing demand for launch capacity, thanks to our iterative approach that accelerates design, testing, and development while minimizing costs. While our groundbreaking research and development in 3D printing pushes the boundaries of large-scale additive manufacturing.
Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals. Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team:
The mission of the Machine Shop is to deliver high-precision, high-quality machined components while pioneering advanced manufacturing methods to support the rapid development and production of Terran-Rs reusable launch system. Through cross-functional collaboration, rigorous quality control, and a commitment to continuous improvement, we play a vital role in accelerating aerospace innovation.
We are responsible for machining critical flight hardware, optimizing manufacturing processes, and ensuring efficiency, reliability, and scalability in high-rate production. Over the past year, the Machine Shop team has successfully developed and refined machining processes for complex propulsion components. Now, we are entering a critical phase: scaling our machining operations to support full-rate vehicle production and enable Terran-Rs first launch to orbit.
