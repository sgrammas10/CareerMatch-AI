Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:  
The Integrated Performance team owns the holistic view of how Terran R comes together, ensuring that every system on the vehicle and ground is capable of achieving our ambitious objectives. The team works across the full launch system, from trajectory design and aerodynamics to reliability analysis and beyond, with direct influence on all parts of the product lifecycle, from conceptual design to post-flight data review. Beyond analysis, team members engage hands-on with hardware and operations, with the mission and authority to drive meaningful programmatic change. With a unique organizational structure, the integrated performance team spans multiple technical domains and embeds directly with partner teams to solve the hardest multi-disciplinary problems. The team operates with a rare scale: large enough to support complex development, yet small enough that individual contributors have meaningful impact.
About the Role: 
As a Mission Assurance Engineer, you will be responsible for working across all engineering disciplines to ensure mission-specific risks have been sufficiently mitigated and our launch system is ready for flight.

Take ownership of risk tracking for a critical element of Terran R program (e.g. fluids, structures, avionics, engine) and manage risk of that element throughout testing and flight
Organize and run flight readiness reviews to ensure technical readiness and flight data reviews to track action items and learnings from flight. Drive actions and findings to completion
Provide real time (on console) support for test and flight as the authority for vehicle risk, communicating to leadership and executive team as required. Drive on-console resolution of technical risks to achieve successful test or flight outcome 
Support anomaly investigations as needed via use of tools such as fault trees, fishbones, and 5 whys. Work to resolve anomalies on day of test and launch in real time on console
Perform independent assessments of subsystem and system designs to develop understanding of vulnerabilities, associated risk, and drive architectural decision-making to improve vehicle reliability

But designing engines with a quarter million pounds of thrust is just the beginning. As the flight configuration enters qualification, the team is now exploring modifications for future engines, including thrust upgrades, new cycles, and design for mass production.
About the Role:
In this role, youll directly contribute to the design and qualification of the Aeon-R and Aeon-V combustion devices hardware from concept to detailed design and test. You will use your experience quantifying conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer to aid design teams in developing high performing injectors, thrust chambers, igniters, and heat exchangers. Not just an expert in running software, youll utilize your expertise to identify appropriate analytical methods, anchor models to test data, and work closely with designers to inform design paths and validate requirement compliance. To be successful in this role, you should have a strong understanding of fundamental physics and how to apply them to new, interesting problems to resolve ambiguity and drive projects to completion. You should be self-motivated, adaptable, and able to contribute significantly to a fast-paced, integrated vehicle program. You will have the opportunity to have a significant influence on major engine hardware and to make rapid professional gains in an environment that encourages growth and risk.
About You:

Bachelor's degree in a science or engineering field
2+ years relevant experience conducting fluids analysis
Experience with analysis tools such as ANSYS, Thermal Desktop, or similar
