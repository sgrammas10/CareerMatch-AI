Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team:  
The Structures team at Relativity is responsible for the design, analysis, testing, and manufacturing our launch vehicle integrated structures, as well as flight mechanisms. As a part of this team, you will be given hardware ownership for the full product lifecycle, and get the opportunity to conveniently validate your hardware through testing at our factory of the future, headquartered in Long Beach, CA. Unique to Relativity, you will get to work across many teams to develop world-class integrated launch vehicles. Overall, this team was critical to the launch success of Terran 1 and is now playing a key role in the development and execution of the Terran R program.
About the Role: 
The scope of work encompasses a full design cycle, including conceptualization, design, analysis, manufacturing and testing for primary and secondary structures related to Thrust Structure, Propellant Tanks, Interstage or Fairing, to name a few. You will need to think creatively and leverage innovation to reduce mass, parts, processes and tooling required.
Your responsibilities will include, but not be limited to the following:

Innovative conceptualization of structural load path, design for complex structures and adjacent system packaging
Review of static &amp; dynamic load inputs, material properties &amp; test as well as structural systems &amp; subsystems requirements
Analysis and sizing of flight structures to ensure timely design reviews and drawing release
Develop and support hardware test campaigns, including test integration, operation and result evaluation
