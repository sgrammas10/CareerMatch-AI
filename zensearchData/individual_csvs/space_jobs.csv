Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:
The Structures and Mechanisms team is responsible for the full design, build, and test lifecycle of Terran Rs integrated structures and flight mechanisms. Whether you're working on highly iterative mechanisms that move or tight-margin structures that shouldnt, youll get hands-on hardware ownership and see the rocket coming to life on the factory floor. Both teams fall under one department, sharing design principles, tools, and an integrated approach that provides a comprehensive view of Terran R. Team members work on multiple parts, not just within a single subsystem, and are empowered to make decisions that directly impact flight hardware. Beyond first flight, youll play a critical role in refining for manufacturability and speed. 
About the Role: 
To be successful in this role, you should be self-motivated, adaptable, and able to complete projects in a fast-paced environment. You will need strong interpersonal skills and the ability to communicate effectively with peers and leadership. You will support cross-functional trade &amp; impact studies, assist in the coordination of changes, and facilitate the resolution of integration and development issues between engineering teams. Ideally, you have significant mechanical or integrated design experience as well as a proven track record of organizing and completing collaborative projects effectively. Your advanced CAD skills enable you to own configuration management standards for our Terran R vehicle, as well as help you mentor other design engineers across the organization. Finally, you also have the ability to earn trust, maintain positive and professional relationships, and strengthen our culture of inclusion. 
Your responsibilities will include, but not be limited to the following:

Designing vehicle structures at various maturity phases: conceptual to critical design
Initial drawing creation and execute revisions due to engineering or manufacturing changes
Ownership of the vehicle BOM configurations, mass inputs, and part release schedule
Define and manage interfaces between vehicle subsystems using appropriate control documents &amp; models
Develop design process improvements via simplification or automation

About You:

Bachelor's degree in engineering or related technical discipline
8+ years of related experience

Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team: 
The Stage Fluids team designs and delivers the propellant, pressurant, pneumatics, and other fluid systems that turn structures into functioning rockets. The team has full ownership across design, production, test, and flight, maintaining a holistic view of Terran R, focused not on isolated parts but integrated functionality. Working on-site at the factory means youre never far from the hardware, enabling rapid iteration and tight feedback loops across design and manufacturing. You wont just be handed requirements: youll be expected to ask the right questions, collaborate with partners across the company, and ultimately find the best solutions for Terran R.
About the Role:
In this role, you will be responsible for the mechanical and structural implementation of the stage fluid systems, ensuring a reliable and efficient operation of our Terran R launch vehicle.

Fluid system hardware mechanical verification analysis including both hand calcs and FEA
Structural design of mounting hardware for various fluid system component and routing
Incorporate 3D printing methods and in fluid system mechanical design
Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA)

The right person for this role will need to be someone who enjoys leading the way for the team on exploring new methods and design approaches. They will have end to end ownership of their designs and immediately see hardware you designed come to fruition. They must be flexible to changes in strategic direction and willing to take full ownership of their projects to ensure we as a company are producing the best possible product while incorporating innovative production methods into their designs.

At Relativity Space, we're entering an exciting new chapter under the leadership of Eric Schmidt, focusing on pioneering advancements in aerospace technology. Guided by a bold mission to redefine space exploration, our team is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible. As we embark on groundbreaking projects in 3D printing and AI-driven manufacturing, our innovation is reshaping how rockets are built and how humanity reaches beyond Earth.
The Terrestrial Software team is at the core of this transformation, building the foundation for an automated rocket factory and integrated launch platform. Their mission is to streamline workflows across the entire lifecycle of Terran R from raw material intake to launch operations and, eventually, manufacturing on Mars.
