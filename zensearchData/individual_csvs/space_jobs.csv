Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.
About the Team:  
The Materials &amp; NDE Engineering team is responsible for the development, characterization, and inspection of materials across the Terran R launch vehicle. We specialize in rapid implementation of material systems through robust internal testing capabilities and first principles driven qualification approaches. We have recently made our first primary structure barrel, supported introduction of next generation powder additive alloys in the Aeon-R engine, and developed 100% in-cell NDE inspection capabilities for WAAM manufactured hardware.
The additive technology team leads research and development of Relativitys Stargate 3D-printing platform and factory operating system to produce large-scale metal structures for the industrial base. The team works with robotics engineers, data scientists, systems engineers, and welders to advance Relativitys innovative tech stack, which leverages autonomy, advanced simulation, machine learning, and robotics. Working at the intersection of hardware and software, the team is creating a unified platform that can perform additive manufacturing, in-situ monitoring, NDE, and subtraction capabilities in a single print cell. Progressing in parallel to Terran R development, Relativitys breakthroughs in large-scale additive manufacturing have the potential to revolutionize the defense industrial base. 
About the Role: 

Responsible for advancing the characterization of our additively manufactured (AM) directed energy deposition (DED) materials, specifically quantifying and improving our internal understanding of material micro/ macrostructure
While this role will supplement Relativity Spaces vehicle development goals through the Materials &amp; Processes teams shared vision, this role will cover a breath of alloys across the aerospace, marine, and defense industries. This role will heavily support the execution of external contract work
Quantify and drive improvements to material micro/ macro structure that inform bulk material properties. Combine interdisciplinary knowledge from the additive/ welding process, non-destructive inspection, machining, post-processing, and traditional metalworking processes to supplement material impacts
Drive improvements to throughput of characterization processes, inform purchases of equipment, and identify external partners that aid in advancing state of the art at Relativity
Generate data pipelines that incorporate both off the shelf and custom codebases to increase throughput and automation of characterization techniques
Interface with computational modeling tools (i.e. Thermocalc, CALPHAD)
Interface with:

Weld development team to interpret welding variables across processes
Materials laboratory staff to characterize materials and processes
Non-destructive examination personnel to understand detected discontinuities
Supply chain to specify vendor requirements, audit criteria, and process controls
Leadership to elevate risks and overcome roadblocks



About You:  

Background  

B.S. and 2+ Years of Experience 
M.S. and 1+ Years of Experience 
PhD. and 0+ Years of Experience 


Experience with additively manufactured material and characterization of AM 

Strong Metallurgical understanding of solidification, alloying considerations, and microstructural effects on properties
Demonstrated understanding of phase diagrams, small scale alloying considerations to material properties


Direct experience performing and advancing microstructural characterization (electron microscopy, diffraction, calorimetry) on additive or welded material
Familiarity with non-destructive examination techniques
Demonstrated experience driving fundamental material understanding at the micro/ meso scale and informing physical phenomena changes to alter them 
Substantial experience performing design of experiments (DoE)
Demonstrated ability to generate technical presentations
Familiarity with material modeling packages and software (Thermocalc, CALPHAD etc)

Nice to haves, but not required:  

Experience with non-destructive examination techniques and an understanding of the physics
Familiarity with fatigue and damage tolerance (FDT) properties and microstructural influences on them

Both contribute to our long-term vision of creating humanitys industrial base on Mars, paving the way for interplanetary life to expand the possibilities of the human experience. This journey begins right here on Earth  where we design, build, and fly rockets to deliver customer payloads to orbit. Terran R, our medium-to-heavy lift reusable rocket, fulfills the growing demand for launch capacity, thanks to our iterative approach that accelerates design, testing, and development while minimizing costs. While our groundbreaking research and development in 3D printing pushes the boundaries of large-scale additive manufacturing.
Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals. Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team:  
The mission of the Engine Manufacturing Department is to deliver high-performing products and innovative manufacturing systems while driving continuous improvements in cost, quality, and lead time. Through cross-functional collaboration, high levels of accountability, and a focus on safety we play a crucial role in building our reusable rocket, Terran-R. We are responsible for providing design feedback on new hardware iterations, pioneering and implementing advanced manufacturing methods and systems, and ultimately delivering engine and vehicle hardware for testing prior to launch. Over the past year, the Engine Manufacturing Team has successfully developed, iterated, and delivered processes and hardware for the first Aeon-R development engines. Now, we are entering a critical phase: producing flight engines that will pave the way for Terran-R's inaugural launch to orbit. 
About the Role: 
Our mission is to change peoples conception of the way rockets are built and flown. As a CNC Programmer/Machinist, you will develop the programs, post G-code, and machine a variety of 3d-printed engine parts. You will develop first article programs and optimize them into production programs. You must be able to write a manufacturing plan, develop your own tooling and fixtures, and collaborate with manufacturing engineers to develop new machining processes. 
In order to be successful in this role, you should be someone who thrives in ambiguity and is able to drive their own projects to completion. You must have the passion, tenacity and resolve to work through challenging issues unique to precision-machined hardware.  Ideally, you are someone who has come from a fast paced, aerospace environment, having completed difficult projects while collaborating effectively with multidisciplinary groups. More specifically, we are looking for:

Someone who can program and operate multi axis machines (2-axis, 3-axis, 5-axis, mill/turn)
Someone with experience programming and operating DMG-MORI machines (NLX, NTX, DMC FD, and DMU series)
Someone who can optimize programs and post code using Esprit, Mastercam or similar CAM software

About You:  

5+ years of experience in CNC machining
2+ years of programming experience
Strong knowledge of GD&amp;T and tolerance stack-up
Ability to program and operate multi-axis high-precision machines (5-axis, 3 axis, lathe, mill/turn)
Ability to manually edit G-code paths/settings to optimize production programs

Nice to haves but not required:  

Experience machining 3D-printed parts
Experience in a startup or agile development environment
Experience working in a flight development program
Experience transitioning parts from first article to production
