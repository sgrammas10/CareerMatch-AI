Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:  
Relativitys Integrated Performance teams ensure that our products work across all systems and disciplines, from trajectory design to aerodynamics to reliability analysis and beyond. Our groups size the Terran R rocket, design its missions for customer success, reliability, and reusability, and ensure that every system on the rocket and ground is engineered correctly for the demanding environments of launch and entry. Recently, we completed the preliminary design and analysis of Terran R including Relativitys first-ever work on launch vehicle reusability, spanning advanced trajectory simulations, wind tunnel testing, and structures analysis, among many other projects.
As a Mission Assurance Engineer, you will be responsible for identifying ways to improve emerging and existing designs and ensure that hardware and concepts of operation meet or exceed requirements. In short, youll be the glue between our analysis, test, certification, and design teams, helping to connect the technical dots and solve problems across our vehicle programs. To be successful in this role, you must be able to synthesize productivity for the program from the myriads of abstract problems and constraints facing an in-development launch vehicle. This will require an element of leadership and interfacing between teams.
