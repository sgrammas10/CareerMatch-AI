The Integrated Performance team owns the holistic view of how Terran R comes together, ensuring that every system on the vehicle and ground is capable of achieving our ambitious objectives. The team works across the full launch system, from trajectory design and aerodynamics to reliability analysis and beyond, with direct influence on all parts of the product lifecycle, from conceptual design to post-flight data review. Beyond analysis, team members engage hands-on with hardware and operations, with the mission and authority to drive meaningful programmatic change. With a unique organizational structure, the integrated performance team spans multiple technical domains and embeds directly with partner teams to solve the hardest multi-disciplinary problems. The team operates with a rare scale: large enough to support complex development, yet small enough that individual contributors have meaningful impact.
About the Role: 
As a System Safety Engineer, you will be responsible for working across all engineering disciplines to ensure mission-specific risks have been sufficiently mitigated and our launch system is ready for flight.

Take ownership of risk tracking for a critical element of Terran R program (e.g. fluids, structures, avionics, engine) and manage risk of that element throughout testing and flight
Organize and run flight readiness reviews to ensure technical readiness and flight data reviews to track action items and learnings from flight. Drive actions and findings to completion

Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team: 
The Avionics team is responsible for the full lifecycle of Terran Rs nervous system, designing, building, testing, installing, and operating the hardware that connects and controls every major electrical system on the vehicle and ground. The teams structure intentionally combines avionics design, manufacturing, and test to enable rapid iteration and feedback loops. Engineers are deeply embedded into other functions within Relativity, working closely with propulsion, GNC, fluids, and stage engineering teams to ensure seamless integration and operation. Now is a unique time to join: youll get to help shape Terran R's fundamental avionics architecture and be given a high degree of ownership on components that will fly.   
About the Role:

Manage a team of engineers responsible for avionics system-level integration, design validation, and test
Oversee the development and operation of integrated system testbed, including HITL test systems and subsystem test platforms
Lead efforts to validate avionics system and subsystem design, including power system validation, fault tolerance and isolation behavior, vehicle network behavior, software validation, etc.
Support flight-vehicle avionics hardware installation and checkouts
Lead the development of integrated-system GSE, including vehicle and engine GSE
Develop vehicle-level avionics CONOPs, go/no-go criteria, system automation, and operator manuals
Support on-console test operations for the avionics system during stage-level test and launch operations

About You:

Bachelor's degree in Electrical, Mechanical, or Aerospace Engineering or a related field
7+ years of experience with integrated systems test, such as flight test, hardware or software design validation, or development of hardware in the loop test platforms
7+ years of experience leading an engineering team
Experience testing, validating, and troubleshooting complex integrated electrical and software systems
Strong systems-level engineering experience and perspective, balanced with experience and engagement in understanding lower level technical details
Strong cross-disciplinary communication skills and ability to prioritize competing tasks

Nice to haves but not required:  

Experience with programming languages such as Python
Electronics design or test experience
Harness design or test experience

The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team: 
The Supply Chain team turns design intent into executable reality, balancing lead time, cost, complexity, and manufacturability to ensure we can build and scale Terran R. On this team, you're not just placing orders; you're actively shaping the solution. With full ownership across raw materials, capital equipment, and services, the role requires both strategic thinking and day-to-day execution. As the company scales, supply chain becomes increasingly central, working closely with engineering, quality, manufacturing, and more to make decisions that work for today but also for tomorrow. This is a team for those who want to operate at the intersection of technical ambition and business execution, driving tangible progress to keep the Terran R program on track.
About the Role:

Receive drawing sets, develop procurement plans, and get parts and assemblies fabricated at a variety of vendors. 
Provide feedback to design engineers on ways to decrease cost and lead time for parts 
Partner closely with engineering during the design process to provide feedback and insights on ways to improve the manufacturability of their designs, ROM prices and lead times. 
Manage end-to-end RFx process in partnership with applicable stakeholders to identify top suppliers for a given need, drive competition within a given supply market, and maximize value creation for the procurement activity. 
Negotiate pricing, lead time, terms and conditions, and more, to holistically drive the best outcome for the business. 
Lead end-to-end purchase order management and invoice issue disposition to ensure on-time delivery of product or services and on-time payment of invoices. This includes processing purchase requests into purchase orders in the ERP system in a timely, efficient manner. 
Resolve any and all procurement-related issues that arise during the life cycle of an order. 
Collaborate with Indirect and Direct procurement functions, who own supplier relationships and build strong partnerships to continually deliver more value to Relativity.
