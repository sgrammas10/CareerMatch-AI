Both contribute to our long-term vision of creating humanitys industrial base on Mars, paving the way for interplanetary life to expand the possibilities of the human experience. This journey begins right here on Earth  where we design, build, and fly rockets to deliver customer payloads to orbit. Terran R, our medium-to-heavy lift reusable rocket, fulfills the growing demand for launch capacity, thanks to our iterative approach that accelerates design, testing, and development while minimizing costs. While our groundbreaking research and development in 3D printing pushes the boundaries of large-scale additive manufacturing.
Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals. Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team: 
The Materials &amp; NDE Engineering team is responsible for the development, characterization, and inspection of materials across the Terran R launch vehicle. We specialize in rapid implementation of material systems through robust internal testing capabilities and first principles driven qualification approaches. We have recently made our first primary structure barrel, supported introduction of next generation powder additive alloys in the Aeon-R engine, and developed 100% in-cell NDE inspection capabilities for WAAM manufactured hardware.
About the Role:

Serve as the companys solely accountable M&amp;P engineer for corrosion control on Terran-R 
Define and implement the overarching Terran-R Corrosion Control Plan for expendable and reusable block manifests and hardware 
Guide and align interdisciplinary partners through corrosion control requirements and rationale 
Research, develop, and integrate novel corrosion control materials and processes 
Mentor engineers on corrosion control best practices and procedures 
Interface with: 

Materials engineering to implement corrosion control across the vehicle 
Laboratory staff to characterize materials and processes 
Designers to identify pain points and drive M&amp;P selection 
Analysts to align M&amp;P data with predictive analytical techniques  
Manufacturing to control processes and improve operations 
Integration to collect data and troubleshoot issues 
Inspectors to develop standards and train personnel 
Supply chain to specify vendor requirements and audit criteria 
Leadership to elevate risks and overcome roadblocks 



About You:

Bachelors degree in materials science or engineering, or related field 
8+ years of experience relevant to the competencies listed below that demonstrate a strong foundation of materials science and engineering principles 
A commitment to accountability, collaboration, and execution 
A desire to establish and foster strong interdisciplinary relationships across the company 
An authentic, introspective, and inclusive mindset towards technical, interpersonal, and team growth and development 

Nice to haves but not required:  

Experience in the corrosion control of coastal launch vehicles or similar naval aerospace products 
Hands-on experience conducting failure investigations, hardware inspections, and relevant laboratory techniques 
Knowledge of property-process-performance-structure relationships of M&amp;P relevant to corrosion control, such as: 

Primary and secondary metallic structures 
Inhibitors, surface treatments, and coatings 


Familiarity with corrosion-relevant M&amp;P engineering disciplines (e.g. fracture mechanics, life analysis, descriptive &amp; inferential statistics) and communities (e.g. AMPP/NACE)
