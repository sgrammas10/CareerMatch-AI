Our goal is instant data accessibility and automated decision-making embedded in every workflow, removing friction and enabling fast, intelligent company-wide operations.
About the Role:
You'll build the analytical backbone for rocket development - interactive data exploration tools, automated test analysis systems, and decision-making engines that turn raw telemetry into actionable engineering insights. The goal is turning weeks of manual data review into automated go/no-go decisions. You'll join our 8-person Factory Platform team within the 40-person Terrestrial Software organization. Direct collaboration with GNC engineers, test engineers, and hardware development teams.
 
Day-to-day: Build interactive React applications for engineers to explore time-series data, compare test families, and identify performance trends. Work directly with GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control) engineers to create specialized analysis tools for flight dynamics and control system validation. Implement automated decision algorithms that flag anomalies, generate test reports, and accelerate our test cadence from days to hours. Design APIs that surface insights from our existing data platform to power analysis workflows.
 
The challenge: Building analytical tools that engineers actually want to use. Interactive visualizations that handle terabytes of telemetry, automated analysis systems that make reliable go/no-go decisions, and creating family data analysis workflows that help engineers understand hardware behavior across hundreds of test runs.

Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals. Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team: 
Terrestrial Software is the central nervous system of Relativity Space, powering design, manufacturing, testing, and launch through a unified stack of enterprise applications, factory automation, and ground systems. Our goal is instant data accessibility and automated decision-making embedded in every workflow, removing friction and enabling fast, intelligent company-wide operations.
About the Role:

You'll build the analytical backbone for rocket development - interactive data exploration tools, automated test analysis systems, and decision-making engines that turn raw telemetry into actionable engineering insights. The goal is turning weeks of manual data review into automated go/no-go decisions. You'll join our 8-person Factory Platform team within the 40-person Terrestrial Software organization. Direct collaboration with GNC engineers, test engineers, and hardware development teams.
 
Day-to-day: Build interactive React applications for engineers to explore time-series data, compare test families, and identify performance trends. Work directly with GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control) engineers to create specialized analysis tools for flight dynamics and control system validation. Implement automated decision algorithms that flag anomalies, generate test reports, and accelerate our test cadence from days to hours. Design APIs that surface insights from our existing data platform to power analysis workflows.
 
The challenge: Building analytical tools that engineers actually want to use. Interactive visualizations that handle terabytes of telemetry, automated analysis systems that make reliable go/no-go decisions, and creating family data analysis workflows that help engineers understand hardware behavior across hundreds of test runs.
 
Stack
Backend: Python, Go, Postgres
Frontend: React, TypeScript
Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Terraform, DBT, Spark
Data: Iceberg, DuckDB, Redshift
About You:


7+ years shipping production software

Both contribute to our long-term vision of creating humanitys industrial base on Mars, paving the way for interplanetary life to expand the possibilities of the human experience. This journey begins right here on Earth  where we design, build, and fly rockets to deliver customer payloads to orbit. Terran R, our medium-to-heavy lift reusable rocket, fulfills the growing demand for launch capacity, thanks to our iterative approach that accelerates design, testing, and development while minimizing costs. While our groundbreaking research and development in 3D printing pushes the boundaries of large-scale additive manufacturing.
Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals.

You will be a part of developing the architecture for the upcoming Terran R vehicle and will be responsible for charting the companys path for gas storage on a reusable rocket- both near term and long term.
Here are some examples of projects you could be working on:

Partnering with third party vendors in the design and analysis of gas storage COPVs
Working with other thermo-fluid engineers on vehicle gas system design and operation
Establishing test campaigns for qualification and acceptance of COPVs
Performing tests and reviewing data
Supporting integration COPVs on the rocket
Selecting, vetting, and managing vendors
Performing trade studies to improve gas storage solutions for the near future vehicles
Assessing long term COPV design and manufacturing plans
