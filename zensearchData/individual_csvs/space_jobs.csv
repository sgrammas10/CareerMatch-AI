Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:  
The Stage Fluids team designs and delivers the propellant, pressurant, pneumatics, and other fluid systems that turn structures into functioning rockets. The team has full ownership across design, production, test, and flight, maintaining a holistic view of Terran R, focused not on isolated parts but integrated functionality.

Working with other thermo-fluid engineers on vehicle gas system design and operation
Establishing test campaigns for qualification and acceptance of COPVs
Performing tests and reviewing data
Supporting integration COPVs on the rocket
Selecting, vetting, and managing vendors
Performing trade studies to improve gas storage solutions for the near future vehicles
Assessing long term COPV design and manufacturing plans

About You:  

Undergraduate degree in engineering or technical discipline
