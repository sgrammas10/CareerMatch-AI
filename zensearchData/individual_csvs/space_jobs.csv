The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:  
The Structures and Mechanisms team is responsible for the full design, build, and test lifecycle of Terran Rs integrated structures and flight mechanisms. Whether you're working on highly iterative mechanisms that move or tight-margin structures that shouldnt, youll get hands-on hardware ownership and see the rocket coming to life on the factory floor. Both teams fall under one department, sharing design principles, tools, and an integrated approach that provides a comprehensive view of Terran R. Team members work on multiple parts, not just within a single subsystem, and are empowered to make decisions that directly impact flight hardware. Beyond first flight, youll play a critical role in refining for manufacturability and speed.
About the Role: 
The scope of work encompasses a full design cycle, including conceptualization, design, analysis, manufacturing and testing for primary and secondary structures related to Thrust Structure, Propellant Tanks, Interstage or Fairing, to name a few. You will need to think creatively and leverage innovation to reduce mass, parts, processes and tooling required.
Your responsibilities will include, but not be limited to the following:

Innovative conceptualization of structural load path, design for complex structures and adjacent system packaging.
Review of static &amp; dynamic load inputs, material properties &amp; test as well as structural systems &amp; subsystems requirements.
Analysis and sizing of flight structures to ensure timely design reviews and drawing release.
Develop and support hardware test campaigns, including test integration, operation and result evaluation.
Support manufacturing process development.

In order to be successful in this role, you must be someone who is self-motivated, adaptable and is able to lead your own projects to completion in a fast-paced environment. Ideally, you have significant mechanical or structural design experience and a proven track record completing collaborative projects effectively.
On a weekly basis, you will be designing flight components for our upcoming Terran R vehicle using NX/TeamCenter, performing analysis using Nastran, ANSYS and/or hand calculations, creating and releasing drawings as well as supporting fabrication of your components. You will own your design from requirements to production. You will also use your strong organizational skills to properly document your work and present your recommendations when decisions are needed.
About You:  

8+ years of experience in a design engineering role.
Bachelors degree in engineering or related technical discipline
Significant experience with industry-standard CAD packages such as NX, Creo, or Solidworks
Working knowledge of structural analysis (hand calculation, Finite Elements Methods and industry tools) and test
Fundamental knowledge of structures strength, stability and fatigue failure mechanisms.
Fundamental knowledge of additive and traditional manufacturing processes
Full life cycle project ownership experience

Nice to haves but not required:  

8+ years of mechanical or structural design &amp; analysis experience.

The Systems Engineering team ensures that Terran R comes together as a cohesive, high-performing, and scalable system. Within the department, one team focuses on building tools and processes to manage requirements, track decisions, and identify and mitigate risk - enabling faster, more informed development across the program. Engineers work across domains to understand complex problems, identify solutions, and implement them  all with deep technical knowledge, not just documentation. The other team focuses on the vehicle itself, working across teams to ensure all subsystems of Terran R function together as intended, burning down technical risk, and driving informed decisions at every stage of the vehicle lifecycle. Engineers are empowered to lead high-impact efforts, from major test campaigns to console operations during launch, and are trusted to drive improvements across fluids, structures, avionics, and more. Regardless of which team youre on, youll be part of a high-visibility, high-impact department at a pivotal moment in the program, where decisions made today on trades, architecture, and process will shape not just the first launch, but the long-term trajectory of Relativity.
About the Role: 
As an Engineer II Systems Engineer you will collaborate with team members across the organization helping responsible engineers leverage already existing processed and tools, while contributing to the development of new engineering processes and tools to enable the design, development, certification, and flight of the Terran R launch system.
Example projects and responsibilities include the following:

Working with Responsible Engineers ensuring processes are effective and updating content to reflect actual progress as needed
Creating automations in Jira and python to streamline existing processes
Collaborate with Technical Project Managers ensuring design scope is accurately captured in our various tools
Communicating with program leadership on the status of design
Brainstorming ways to improve our current processes and then implementing those ideas
Prototype, implement, and rollout processes, tools, and automation that enable better design and test collaboration across the company

To be successful in this role, you should be self-motivated, adaptable, and able to contribute significantly to a fast-paced integrated vehicle program. You should also be able to resolve ambiguity and drive projects to completion. Ideally, you have Systems Engineering, Process development, Verification and Validation (V&amp;V), and Requirement Management experience, as well as a proven track record completing projects successfully in a highly collaborative environment.
On a weekly basis, you will be supporting design teams, developing processes tools, and performing analysis. You will also use your strong organizational skills to properly manage the documentation and communication of your actions, recommendations, and decisions.
About You: 

An undergraduate degree in engineering or related field 
2+ years relevant experience
Experience creating scripts
Experience using Jira and Confluence
Experience solving difficult problems with multiple stakeholders in a fast-paced environment
Proven track record of contributing to project completion
Expertise in modern systems engineering practices and tools
Experience applying written and oral communication skills

Nice to haves, but not required:

About the Team
 
The Quality team is focused on embedding quality into every part of the design and production process for Terran R. Not just inspecting at the end but influencing how things are built from the start. The team embeds themselves directly within design, manufacturing, test, and launch teams to stay close to the hardware, understand constraints, and proactively shape decisions. As we move beyond initial development into production and then scaled operations, now is the time to put the right processes, controls, and inspections in place without slowing down progress. The team plays a key role in balancing risk, driving a culture of ownership, and ensuring that speed doesnt come at the cost of reliability. Success here means building a quality system that scales with the Terran R program and Relativity as a whole.
