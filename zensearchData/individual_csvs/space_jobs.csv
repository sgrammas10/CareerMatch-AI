We build rockets with advanced manufacturing techniques. Our Data Analysis Platform group within the Factory Platform team creates the software that transforms how engineers analyze test results, understand hardware performance, and accelerate development cycles.
About the Role:
You'll build the analytical backbone for rocket development - interactive data exploration tools, automated test analysis systems, and decision-making engines that turn raw telemetry into actionable engineering insights. The goal is turning weeks of manual data review into automated go/no-go decisions.
Day-to-day: Build interactive React applications for engineers to explore time-series data, compare test families, and identify performance trends. Work directly with GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control) engineers to create specialized analysis tools for flight dynamics and control system validation. Implement automated decision algorithms that flag anomalies, generate test reports, and accelerate our test cadence from days to hours. Design APIs that surface insights from our existing data platform to power analysis workflows.
The challenge: Building analytical tools that engineers actually want to use. Interactive visualizations that handle terabytes of telemetry, automated analysis systems that make reliable go/no-go decisions, and creating family data analysis workflows that help engineers understand hardware behavior across hundreds of test runs.

You'll build our entire in-house ERP stack from scratch - manufacturing execution systems (MES), production planning engines, and durable workflow orchestration that runs our factory autonomously. The core challenge is automating complex manufacturing processes that span weeks while handling failures gracefully. You'll join our 8-person Factory Platform team within the 40-person Terrestrial Software organization. Direct collaboration with manufacturing engineers, test engineers, and operations staff.
Day-to-day: Design workflow engines that coordinate hundreds of interdependent manufacturing steps. Build state machines that handle multi-week production cycles with automatic retry logic, human escalation, and rollback capabilities. Write planning algorithms that optimize schedules around material constraints, equipment availability, and test windows. Create fully-featured web applications used by technicians, engineers, and operators across the factory - everything from work order management to real-time process monitoring and intervention tools.
The challenge: Building enterprise software that doesn't suck. Durable workflow execution across weeks-long manufacturing cycles, automated decision-making with human oversight, and state management for hundreds of concurrent processes. Plus planning algorithms that optimize around physical constraints and real-time factory conditions.

Our goal is instant data accessibility and automated decision-making embedded in every workflow, removing friction and enabling fast, intelligent company-wide operations.
About the Role:

You'll build the analytical backbone for rocket development - interactive data exploration tools, automated test analysis systems, and decision-making engines that turn raw telemetry into actionable engineering insights. The goal is turning weeks of manual data review into automated go/no-go decisions. You'll join our 8-person Factory Platform team within the 40-person Terrestrial Software organization. Direct collaboration with GNC engineers, test engineers, and hardware development teams.
 
Day-to-day: Build interactive React applications for engineers to explore time-series data, compare test families, and identify performance trends. Work directly with GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control) engineers to create specialized analysis tools for flight dynamics and control system validation. Implement automated decision algorithms that flag anomalies, generate test reports, and accelerate our test cadence from days to hours. Design APIs that surface insights from our existing data platform to power analysis workflows.
 
The challenge: Building analytical tools that engineers actually want to use. Interactive visualizations that handle terabytes of telemetry, automated analysis systems that make reliable go/no-go decisions, and creating family data analysis workflows that help engineers understand hardware behavior across hundreds of test runs.
