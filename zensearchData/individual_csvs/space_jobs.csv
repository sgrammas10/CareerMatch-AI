Terrestrial Software is the central nervous system of Relativity Space, powering design, manufacturing, testing, and launch through a unified stack of enterprise applications, factory automation, and ground systems. Our goal is instant data accessibility and automated decision-making embedded in every workflow, removing friction and enabling fast, intelligent company-wide operations.
About the Role:
You'll build the analytical backbone for rocket development - interactive data exploration tools, automated test analysis systems, and decision-making engines that turn raw telemetry into actionable engineering insights. The goal is turning weeks of manual data review into automated go/no-go decisions. You'll join our 8-person Factory Platform team within the 40-person Terrestrial Software organization. Direct collaboration with GNC engineers, test engineers, and hardware development teams.
 
Day-to-day: Build interactive React applications for engineers to explore time-series data, compare test families, and identify performance trends. Work directly with GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control) engineers to create specialized analysis tools for flight dynamics and control system validation. Implement automated decision algorithms that flag anomalies, generate test reports, and accelerate our test cadence from days to hours. Design APIs that surface insights from our existing data platform to power analysis workflows.
 
The challenge: Building analytical tools that engineers actually want to use. Interactive visualizations that handle terabytes of telemetry, automated analysis systems that make reliable go/no-go decisions, and creating family data analysis workflows that help engineers understand hardware behavior across hundreds of test runs.

Your journey with us is more than just a job  its an opportunity to shape the future of aerospace technology, additive manufacturing, and the human experience alongside a community of passionate, creative individuals. Join us on this extraordinary journey, as we work together to transform our vision into reality.About the Team:  
The Stage Fluids and Components team is responsible for all fluid systems and components on the Terran R launch vehicle. This includes systems for the liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas propellants as well as the supporting helium and nitrogen gasses. We also design the individual valves that are used within these systems on the stages and engines. This requires us to integrate our designs with those of the structures, propulsion, avionics hardware teams. It also requires us to work closely with the GNC and performance teams to ensure that our systems can meet the requirements of launching and landing a reusable rocket. Finally, we also work closely with the manufacturing and test teams to ensure our hardware is adequately built and tested.
About the Role: 
In this role you will be responsible for the design, analysis, development and qualification of flow control devices for the Aeon R engine and Terran R launch vehicle.
Specific responsibilities will include:

Design and analysis of clean sheet of cryogenic, pneumatic, proportional, or solenoid valves
Detailed fluid, thermal, and structural analysis of piece parts and assemblies
Development and qualification test planning and execution of internally developed valves
Engine and vehicle test support for existing flow control products
Conducting trade studies to produce architectures and designs that satisfy system requirements
