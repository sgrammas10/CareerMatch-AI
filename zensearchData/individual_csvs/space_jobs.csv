Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team:  
The Structures and Mechanisms team is responsible for the full design, build, and test lifecycle of Terran Rs integrated structures and flight mechanisms. Whether you're working on highly iterative mechanisms that move or tight-margin structures that shouldnt, youll get hands-on hardware ownership and see the rocket coming to life on the factory floor. Both teams fall under one department, sharing design principles, tools, and an integrated approach that provides a comprehensive view of Terran R. Team members work on multiple parts, not just within a single subsystem, and are empowered to make decisions that directly impact flight hardware. Beyond first flight, youll play a critical role in refining for manufacturability and speed.
About the Role: 
The scope of work encompasses a full design cycle, including conceptualization, design, analysis, manufacturing and testing for primary and secondary structures related to Thrust Structure, Propellant Tanks, Interstage or Fairing, to name a few. You will need to think creatively and leverage innovation to reduce mass, parts, processes and tooling required.
Your responsibilities will include, but not be limited to the following:

Innovative conceptualization of structural load path, design for complex structures and adjacent system packaging.
Review of static &amp; dynamic load inputs, material properties &amp; test as well as structural systems &amp; subsystems requirements.
Analysis and sizing of flight structures to ensure timely design reviews and drawing release.
Develop and support hardware test campaigns, including test integration, operation and result evaluation.
Support manufacturing process development.

In order to be successful in this role, you must be someone who is self-motivated, adaptable and is able to lead your own projects to completion in a fast-paced environment. Ideally, you have significant mechanical or structural design experience and a proven track record completing collaborative projects effectively.
On a weekly basis, you will be designing flight components for our upcoming Terran R vehicle using NX/TeamCenter, performing analysis using Nastran, ANSYS and/or hand calculations, creating and releasing drawings as well as supporting fabrication of your components. You will own your design from requirements to production. You will also use your strong organizational skills to properly document your work and present your recommendations when decisions are needed.
About You:  

8+ years of experience in a design engineering role.
Bachelors degree in engineering or related technical discipline
Significant experience with industry-standard CAD packages such as NX, Creo, or Solidworks
Working knowledge of structural analysis (hand calculation, Finite Elements Methods and industry tools) and test
Fundamental knowledge of structures strength, stability and fatigue failure mechanisms.
Fundamental knowledge of additive and traditional manufacturing processes
Full life cycle project ownership experience

Nice to haves but not required:  

8+ years of mechanical or structural design &amp; analysis experience.
Extensive experience with NX/TeamCenter.
Expertise using Nastran and ANSYS.
Experience with GD&amp;T and drafting.
