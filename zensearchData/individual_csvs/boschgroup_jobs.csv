Understanding the ageing behaviors of PEM electrolyzer components under industrially relevant operation conditions is of paramount importance for developing a low cost and robust PEM electrolyzer stack as well as further improving the stack operation strategy.You will work on identifying and undertanding the degradation mechanisms of one core component in the PEM electrolyzers. Both electrochemical and analytical methods will be developed and validated as ageing descriptors in this project. Through the design of experiments (DOE) at sub-scale the main ageing stressors of the individual component are captured, degradation mechanisms are elucidated. Based on the understanding a specific ageing model will be established to predict the state of health (SoH) under industrial operation conditions.Create something new: Work with an international research team, closely cooperate with product development team, take advantage of in-field operation data shared by customers, uncover the degradation mechanisms of the PEM electrolyzer in real world operation.Do excellent research: Make active use of the available expertise in our internal research team and your academic environment.Take responsibility: Being a doer instead of a dreamer, you are encouraged to take initiatives towards your PhD project progress under the safeguards of both industrial and academic supervisors. Being aware that an hour spent on literature research or at the phone can save months of laboratory work, you make sure that you are on top of both external and internal knowledge, in order to deliver a most valuable contribution.Share your knowledge: Boost the work of our internal interdisciplinary and international research team, and publish your results in high-impact journals.Education: excellent Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering or relatedExperience and Knowledge: solid background in electrochemistry and electrochemical reactors, e.g. PEM fuel cells, PEM or AEM electrolyzers; hands-on experience with characterization of fuel cell or electrolyzer sub-scale cells; familiar with standard electrochemical analytical methods, e.g. CV, LSV, EIS etc.; basic programming skills (e.g. Python) and experience with simulation tools (Comsol) or numerical optimization approaches is beneficialPersonality and Working Practice: you are open-minded, critical thinking regarding scientific questions, collaborative, highly motivated and eager to learnLanguages: very good in English, German is helpful, but not mandatoryhttps://www.bosch-ai.com
