Our team explores the use of Artificial Intelligence and knowledge engineering to accelerate the Boschs transition towards a circular economy. Key application areas are design, manufacturing, industrial automation, robotics, energy optimization, recycling, supply chain optimization and sustainable product EoL (End-of-life) management.Disassembly is a critical step for sustainable Product EoL management, yet full automation remains challenging due to product heterogeneity and the lack of standardized procedures. Leveraging advanced AI agents including multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), to enhance Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide structured representations of products, materials, and processes, enabling efficient and adaptive disassembly for high-mix-low-volume EoL product scenarios. This AI-driven framework could optimize resource utilization and promote safety, and also support human operators in complex disassembly tasks, advancing automation and sustainability in line with circular economy principles.This position offers an exciting opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research in developing and validating agent-based system for product-agnostic disassembly step generation.
