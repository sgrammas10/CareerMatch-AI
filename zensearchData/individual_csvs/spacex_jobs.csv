SpaceX is looking for engineers with backgrounds in electrical engineering and software development to bring new silicon to life. The ideal candidate will have real-world experience in multiple areas that span the hardware/software boundary: RF measurements, automation software, hardware development, and embedded firmware. You will be part of a multidisciplinary team focused on solving challenging problems related to the silicon used in all terrestrial/space-based elements of a high-performance wireless digital communication system. You will join a team with extreme ownership of the silicon life-cycle, from system requirements, to chip design, to characterization, to production ramp-up, to on-orbit telemetry monitoring.
RESPONSIBILITIES:
As an engineer on the RFIC team, you will solve challenging problems related to all aspects of the RF silicon that we design in-house. Much of the measurement system software and hardware that you create will be first-generation, supporting RF/RFIC designs well into the future.

Design and build unique and technically-challenging automated measurement systems in ways that off-the-shelf equipment may not be capable of capturing. Often this involves creating both new hardware and software designs.
Bring up new silicon, often being the first engineer to power on chips for the very first time
Develop tools and reusable libraries for instrument control, data collection and analysis of the radio subsystems
Deeply understand measurement data to gain insight into both component and system performance
Create fully-validated reference designs (both hardware and software drivers) for new silicon, and support integration into downstream areas such as phased-array panel bring-up, production, and flight software

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS:

Bachelors degree in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering or physics
1+ years of experience in software development in a high level language like C#, Python, or C++

PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:

Masters degree or PhD in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering or physics
Strong communication skills and ability to work well within a fast-paced team
Hands-on experience with radio-related test equipment such as spectrum analyzers, vector signal analyzers, vector signal generators, and network analyzers
Experience with serial digital communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, JTAG, RFFE, software/hardware solutions to exercise these, and hands-on experience troubleshooting with oscilloscopes and logic analyzers
Experience with Python, MATLAB or JMP for data analysis
Experience with microcontrollers, FPGAs, and/or basic digital signal processing concepts
Strong troubleshooting and debugging skills (both software and hardware)

Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.MECHANICAL DESIGN ENGINEER (STARSHIP COMPONENTS) 
The Propulsion Components team develops the most advanced spacecraft and launch vehicle components in the world. Our engineers serve as hardware experts for the flow and position control devices that drive the critical capabilities on the Starship/Super Heavy Vehicle- from regulators and butterfly valves to flap actuators. We design, develop and characterize components for simplicity, manufacturability and reliability in extreme environments, with temperatures ranging from 80 to 800 K, and pressures beyond 800 bar. As a Propulsion Components Engineer at SpaceX, you will have the opportunity to utilize your knowledge, experience, and creativity to develop novel solutions at the cutting edge of space technology. You will own the relationship between our vehicle hardware/systems teams and manufacturing teams while spearheading your own projects, utilizing your skills in analysis, development testing, and mechanical design. You will provide input into vehicle architecture trades and take a lead role in design and flight readiness on Starship, the vehicle that will make humanity multi-planetary.
RESPONSIBILITIES: 

Develop state-of-the-art, manufacturable flow control devices (valves, regulators, solenoids) and mechanisms (flap/fin/payload door actuators) across Starship and Super Heavy stage systems. Question requirements, delete parts and processes, simplify/optimize, accelerate, and automate component deliveries
Partner with manufacturing, production, testing, and supply chain to achieve SpaceXs highest-yet component build rate, striving for high factory yield and automotive volume/cost. Accelerate component delivery to &gt;1 full stacked launch vehicle per month
Generate and maintain detailed drawings, component specifications, analysis and risk assessments
Spearhead root cause investigations that arise in development, production, test, integration and launch, implement corrective actions to prevent repeat failures
Set the standard for rigorous component design and qualification testing, increasing scrutiny as the vehicle matures in pursuit of commercial and crewed orbital missions
Target zero in-flight anomalies of propulsion components. Reduce component-caused production and launch delays, and minimize containments
Act as the chief engineer, collaborating with stage/component teams to arrive at the simplest solution for the vehicle. Inform system-level architecture, with component capabilities and vulnerabilities in mind, to minimize cost of payload to orbit

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS:

Bachelors degree in physics or an engineering discipline
1+ years of mechanical design/hands-on manufacturing experience (internships and project teams qualify)

PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:

Strong interpersonal and collaborative skills, enthusiasm for problem solving, and desire to optimize modern rocket production and launch processes
