As a Starlink Specialist, you will take ownership of state-of-the-art production processes, equipment performance, manufacturing, and reliability by monitoring process parameters and maintaining components, with a keen eye for leading indicators of instability or malfunction, and a drive to correct those issues in advance of undesirable events. This role is critical to helping enable high-volume user terminal production. Your work will form the backbone for millions of next-generation devices used all over the world in homes, schools, businesses, vehicles, aircraft, and watercraft. This team plays an instrumental role in ensuring high-speed connectivity is available to all who need it.
We are looking for talented, creative, and driven Specialists to drive manufacturing tools and processes, from initial concept development to full-scale production. You will drive the relationship between engineering, development, and production teams and will interact regularly with department leadership. The success of Starlink depends on the quality, reliability, cost, manufacturability, throughput, security, and user experience of the products that you deliver.
