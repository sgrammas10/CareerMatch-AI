So, while you are not expected to simply go it alone, you are expected to show initiative, take responsibility, and run with tasks to completion. 
Your day-to-day routine will change often as hiring priorities shift, but there is a basic set of activities you can expect to run with daily, including, but not limited to:

Meet with your client groups to discuss headcount, new requisitions, hiring strategy, and/or interview feedback  you truly act as a partner to your clients and not merely as an order taker
Screen candidates who apply to requisitions  as the SpaceX name brand grows, our job postings continue to fill up with stellar candidates
Source candidates  often the best candidates are the ones not actively looking
Discuss candidates you have screened with your client groups and recommend top candidates for interviews
Give tours to candidates before their onsite
Attend interviews alongside your client groups to act as another set of eyes and ears in evaluating candidates
Once candidates are approved for hire, you will begin the offer process including initiating background checks, negotiating offer packages and extending offer letters

Some days you will have multiple candidates coming onsite for interviews and you will spend that time giving tours and coordinating the candidate experience. Other days, you will need to fill your candidate pipeline and will spend the majority of the day screening/sourcing candidates. No day is the same here and the pace moves fast, but ultimately your job is to effectively attract, organize, and manage the flow of the countrys most talented individuals.
