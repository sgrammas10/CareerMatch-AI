The role offers an exciting and well-balanced caseload that includes consults, surgery, and inpatient duties including emergency and critical care. Shape Your Schedule: Flexibility that Work for You!     We know that everyone has demands and priorities outside of their career and we want to make it brilliantly easy for you to strike the right balance. Whether you are looking to fix or flex your work patterns, we can find the right solution for you. Typically, a full time role would involve working 40 hours per week, over 4 days or 5 days per week (depending on your preference), along with our shared (approximately 2 in 10 at present) Saturday rota. Saturdays currently involve one short consulting session and one slightly longer inpatient and emergency shift meaning you have the backup of both experienced vets and nurses.  More about usWe aim to provide the best possible client and patient care, and our facilities reflect this. Our first opinion referral hospital at Meir Park is kitted out and maintained to a high standard. With cat-friendly waiting areas and a separate cat ward. We also have two dog wards, one for large and one for smaller dogs, and a separate ward for exotics. 3 operating rooms, two for soft-tissue surgeries and one for orthopaedic cases, as well as a separate suite for minor ops or chemotherapy. Endoscopy, ultrasound, laparoscopy, K-laser and CT scanner on-site and a fully kitted lab. We provide advanced practitioner led referral services in internal medicine, soft tissue, orthopaedics, dermatology and ECC at our hospital. We are a host practice for Vets Now who provide our out of hours care. This ensures constant 24-hour care of our inpatients at our hospital, while we sleep at night.We also have a well-appointed ISFM Gold accredited cat clinic situated only ten minutes drive from the main hospital. It is also kitted out to a high standard with CR x-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, K-Laser and a full lab. Every aspect has been designed by our vets and nurses with cats in mind.Here's what the team have to sayI whole heartedly believe that as a vet you would struggle to find a better job than Lime Trees. There are so many different factors that play into that statement, and I think I will struggle to fully get across what makes me say that, because its more of a feeling than anything I can define. The staff are incredibly supportive from client care to leadership, everyone is always there to help and muck in. No problem is too big or too small and on a local level I think you would struggle to get this level of support at any other practice or in any profession for that matter. This is extended to the clients as well and you can really feel it from everyone here. They really do care, about not just the patient but also the client. I have been spoilt whilst working here with regards to clinical practice. The scope to expand your capabilities is unrivalled with regular clinical meetings, expert clinicians in almost every aspect of the job in the building, and on top of that, top of the range equipment. Ill finish as I started, you can look for another practice, but you wont find a better one. - James 2023 GraduateAn excellent place to live and workBoth locations are within easy access of the beautiful Peak District, with excellent transport links in all directions, including rail links to the bright city lights, the closest of which is Manchester.
