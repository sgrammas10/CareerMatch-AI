Take your next step with Seafield Veterinary Group Our successful candidate will be a motivated, confident RVN, who is ideally able to work flexibly across our Banff or Buckie branches - however, if you have a strong preference for one site, we're happy to accommodate that provided you are able to support the team with absences and holiday cover as needed. Banff: at our Banff branch, you'll experience a quieter, more autonomous working day alongside a small and steady team. As the sole RVN, you should be confident working independently and with initiative across a variety of routine procedures, as well as supporting with some orthopaedic surgeries. Client care and engagement is a prominent factor at this branch, where you should be confident in running nurse consults &amp; clinics and providing appropriate guidance to your clients on general, post-op and preventative healthcare advice. You'll be supported by 1-2 Vets or will occasionally work sole charge on an afternoon, as well as 1 VCA/SVN and our Reception team.

Buckie: our Buckie branch is fast paced and you'll work as part of a slightly larger team, so this would be better suited to someone who enjoys thinking on their feet and collaborating as a team. We see a mixture of routine and emergency cases here, and are supportive of our RVNs being involved in Schedule 3 procedures wherever possible. Some of our team at Buckie rotate between here and our main site in Keith, so if you enjoy working with a more varied team this site would be perfectly suited to you. As standard, you will work alongside 2 vets, another RVN, and have the support of our SVN, VCA and Reception teams. We have exciting plans in the works to increase our facilities and service offering at Buckie in the not too distant future. Both sites offer a slightly different pace, team dynamic and caseload - but are united in offering you a chance to make a real difference, utilise your nursing skills, be supported in pursuing your interests and help to steer the practice forward. All while supporting us with the delivery of an exceptional level of patient and client care. We are the only veterinary clinic in the town, so we see interesting cases and a real community value in the practice.
