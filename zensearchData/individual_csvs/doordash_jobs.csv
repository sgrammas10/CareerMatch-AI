Join us in our global mission to empower and grow local economies!
About the Role
DoorDashs alcohol business is especially dependent on the success of SMBs (small-to-medium businesses). Were looking for someone to cultivate and lead our growth strategy with SMB merchants. Growth entails expanding SMB selection (onboarding new businesses) and growing same store sales. You will set the vision, track success and partner with our sales team to put that vision in motion. We are looking for a collaborative, analytical, and action-oriented operator who is excited to roll up their sleeves, dig into the data, and solve complex problems to improve the operation and grow the business! You will report into a Manager on the Alcohol Strategy &amp; Operations team. We operate in a hybrid model so we spend a few days a quarter in person together, but all our offices are open should you choose to go in more regularly!
Youre excited about this opportunity because you will...

Build &amp; scale. Youll have your fingerprints all over DoorDashs Alcohol business. Youll do whatever it takes to launch, get 1% better every day, and scale something completely new. This means everything from high-level strategy to nitty-gritty operational details.

Analyze. Youll assess the operational and financial impacts of your decisions, and iterate based on data.
Experiment. Youll transform strategies into operational experiments that create measurable and actionable outcomes, informing your larger initiative implementation plans.
Collaborate &amp; lead. Youll work with cross-functional teams, including sales, product, and engineering to build this new line of business for DoorDash.

Were excited about you because...

You solve problems from first principles. Youre excited to solve problems in innovative ways, and you resist this is how its always been done thinking.
Youre equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You dont hesitate to get in the weeds and operate at the lowest level of detail, but youre just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team. No job is beneath you.
Youre analytical. You let data win arguments, and youre comfortable building complex SQL queries across multiple data sources and have experience with data visualization and dashboarding tools.
Youre unafraid of ambiguity. Rapid change and learning is exciting to you, and you thrive in ambiguous, startup environments
Youre customer focused. You are able to identify user pain points, lead with the user front of mind and build go to market strategy to enhance our merchant experience. 
You have 4-6+ years of experience. Youve succeeded in high-performance cultures (whether in tech, operations, strategy, consulting, banking, or a related experience).
You have a completed Bachelors Degree.
