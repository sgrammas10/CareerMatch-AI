You have strong written and verbal communication skills

One Team One Fight: Support operations in both the warehouse and kitchen, assist with day-to-day tasks, and lead by example.You will be expected to engage in professional and respectful interactions with team members and customers, ensuring a positive and safe atmosphere in the warehouse while providing a high-quality experience for our customers.

You have the ability and desire to obtain and maintain a food handling certificate. (DoorDash will provide this training)
You have a high school diploma or GED equivalent. A college diploma is even better but not required.
