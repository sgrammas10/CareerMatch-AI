The Traffic team owns the critical path between our customers and our services.

At our scale, milliseconds matter and resiliency is non-negotiable.
We build and operate foundational components like our Envoy-based service mesh, global load balancing, zero-trust networking, and network observability systems. Were also driving strategic initiatives around multi-region routing, intelligent failover, and edge-to-mesh traffic optimization.
The challenges are complex, often cross-cutting, and require a mindset that blends systems thinking with pragmatic execution. If you enjoy working at the intersection of performance, reliability, and distributed systems and you like proving it with data then youll thrive here.

The Compute team powers everything that runs inside our platform. We provide the infrastructure and automation that enables engineers to build, ship, and operate services at scale with confidence. Our work touches everything from container orchestration and scheduling to provisioning, runtime optimization, and developer experience.
We manage our Kubernetes-based platform, CI/CD pipelines, and core abstractions that simplify complex infrastructure for internal teams. Were focused on leverage, building self-service, scalable, and secure systems that help product teams move fast without sacrificing reliability or cost efficiency.
This is a team where foundational engineering meets platform strategy. Were deeply invested in automation, observability, and doing infrastructure the boring way by making it robust, reliable, and invisible when it needs to be.
About the Role
Were hiring an Engineering Manager to lead one of our core infrastructure teams, Traffic or Compute. In this role, youll drive the technical vision and execution for building highly available, cost-effective, and performant infrastructure. Youll partner with senior engineers and cross-functional stakeholders to design and operate systems that power our platform's reliability and scale. Whether its service mesh, Kubernetes orchestration, or cloud integration, your team will be at the heart of solving some of our toughest engineering problems. We work with technologies like AWS EKS, Python, Terraform, and Buildkite, but were just as excited about what we havent discovered yet. This is an opportunity to lead a team at the frontier of cloud infrastructure, with room to experiment and innovate. 
Youre excited about this opportunity because you will...

Lead and mentor a team of experienced engineers, fostering a culture of excellence, inclusion, and ownership
Champion data-informed decision-making and continuous improvement across the team
Oversee the design and operation of scalable, reliable infrastructure, while proactively managing down technical debt
Collaborate with product and engineering leadership to drive long-term architectural direction and influence company-wide strategy
Guide the team through ambiguity, leveraging industry best practices while also knowing when to break the mold
Communicate with clarity, whether explaining a trade-off to execs or mapping technical strategy across teams
Drive alignment across teams and disciplines, leading high-impact cross-functional initiatives
Stay current on the latest trends in cloud infrastructure, and bring back ideas worth pursuing
Build, sustain, and grow a diverse team to address the growing needs of the organization

Were excited about you because you have...

7+ years of hands-on software development, including experience at scale with Kubernetes or service mesh with 3+ years designing and operating cloud-native systems in AWS, Azure, or GCP
2+ years leading engineering teams
Experience managing infrastructure teams with high operational standards and a culture of innovation
Built or scaled traffic systems (L7/L4 routing, load balancing, traffic policy) or youve led compute platform teams working with scheduling, orchestration, or provisioning with Kubernetes at scale
A strong bias for action, pragmatic problem-solving, and technical depth
Demonstrated success leading cross-functional initiatives with measurable impact

We value a diverse workforce  people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Thank you to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.
