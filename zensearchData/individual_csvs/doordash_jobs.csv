In the Fraud Operations department, the Insights Team plays a crucial role in generating actionable insights to counteract persistent fraud, enhance internal procedures, and uncover innovative approaches to fraud detection.

DoorDashs alcohol business is especially dependent on the success of SMBs (small-to-medium businesses). Were looking for someone to cultivate and lead our growth strategy with SMB merchants. Growth entails expanding SMB selection (onboarding new businesses) and growing same store sales. You will set the vision, track success and partner with our sales team to put that vision in motion. We are looking for a collaborative, analytical, and action-oriented operator who is excited to roll up their sleeves, dig into the data, and solve complex problems to improve the operation and grow the business! You will report into a Manager on the Alcohol Strategy &amp; Operations team. We operate in a hybrid model so we spend a few days a quarter in person together, but all our offices are open should you choose to go in more regularly!

You solve problems from first principles. Youre excited to solve problems in innovative ways, and you resist this is how its always been done thinking.
Youre equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You dont hesitate to get in the weeds and operate at the lowest level of detail, but youre just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team. No job is beneath you.
Youre analytical. You let data win arguments, and youre comfortable building complex SQL queries across multiple data sources and have experience with data visualization and dashboarding tools.
Youre unafraid of ambiguity. Rapid change and learning is exciting to you, and you thrive in ambiguous, startup environments
Youre customer focused. You are able to identify user pain points, lead with the user front of mind and build go to market strategy to enhance our merchant experience. 
You have 4-6+ years of experience. Youve succeeded in high-performance cultures (whether in tech, operations, strategy, consulting, banking, or a related experience).
You have a completed Bachelors Degree.

You move fast: speed excites you. You prefer to achieve results today rather than waiting for tomorrow.
You can toggle between strategic and tactical: youre equally comfortable with thinking through complex problems and getting into the weeds to execute.
