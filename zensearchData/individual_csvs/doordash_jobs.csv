Drive execution: Own and deliver discrete projects that move our key metrics (e.g., deposits, bill pay adoption, dispute resolution SLA).
Experiment &amp; learn: Design and test hypotheses, measure impact, and help scale what works.
Collaborate: Work cross-functionally with Product, Engineering, Analytics, Marketing, and Legal to launch and improve initiatives.
Grow fast: Build the toolkit of a future operator/GM by working on zero-to-one fintech problems in a high-growth environment.

Were excited about you because...
