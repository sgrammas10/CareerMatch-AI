We are on a mission to build a reliable, fast, and scalable search platform for DoorDash. This team is responsible for providing capabilities like search indexing, retrieval and ranking to help consumers find the most relevant merchants and products on DoorDash. We work across three dimensions.
Scale - DoorDash has millions of merchants and billions of items. We index over a billion documents in our index and serve thousands of QPS running expensive operations on millions of documents per second. This requires the platform to be scalable, reliable, fast, and provide high app quality.

Relevance (aka Quality) - Machine Learning engineers regularly experiment with new relevance algorithms to improve search quality. This requires the platform to provide relevance capabilities like query understanding, multi-stage ranking, and semantic search to improve recall and precision.
The team is a part of Core Consumer org, which owns the top of the conversion funnel from the initial landing page to checkout across iOS, Android, and Web platforms. With a universal Search bar on the home page, as Doordash expands into new verticals like Grocery, there is a growing need to help consumers easily find what they want, so the opportunity is massive and we are just getting started!

You move fast: speed excites you. You prefer to achieve results today rather than waiting for tomorrow.
You can toggle between strategic and tactical: youre equally comfortable with thinking through complex problems and getting into the weeds to execute.
You have relevant experience. You have 3-5+ years of experience in growth, product, solutions architecture, sales engineering, product ops, strategy/biz ops, or technical GTM roles  ideally in a fast-paced environment focused on outcomes.
