You will help create quarterly and annual plans that push our business forward and are aligned with our product capabilities. You will help these teams identify opportunities for enhancing our existing product offering and methods to improve delivery quality.

Were excited about you because...

You solve problems from first principles. Youre excited to think innovatively, and you resist this is how its always been done thinking.

Youre analytical. Youre comfortable building complex SQL queries across multiple data sources and have experience with data visualization and dashboarding tools
You have 2-4+ years of experience. Youve succeeded in high-performing cultures (tech, operations, strategy, consulting, banking, startups or a related experience). DoorDash experience is a plus!
