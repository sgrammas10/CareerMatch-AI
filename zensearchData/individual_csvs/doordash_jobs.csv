Youre even-keeled: you thrive under pressure and maintain a sense of calm when facing challenging and time-sensitive goals. 
Youre a builder: you thrive on building from the ground up. You excel at creating structure and process, and youre resourceful in figuring out answers to complex questions with minimal oversight.  Youve used many software tools and are ready to dive into learning how to leverage new ones.
Youre low ego: you want to GSD and are willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen; no responsibility or task is too trivial or too tactical.
You move fast: speed excites you. You prefer to achieve results today rather than waiting for tomorrow.
You can toggle between strategic and tactical: youre equally comfortable with thinking through complex problems and getting into the weeds to execute.
You have relevant experience. You have 3-5+ years of experience in growth, product, solutions architecture, sales engineering, product ops, strategy/biz ops, or technical GTM roles  ideally in a fast-paced environment focused on outcomes.
You are an eager learner: ecomm, tech and digital spaces are rapidly evolving, but you enjoy learning how to incorporate new technologies into your approach and are ready to self-teach by diving into technical documentation.

We expect this position to be filled by 8/29/2025.

You know how to organize and motivate a broad, diverse and geographically dispersed working team around a shared goal.

Have a proven ability to earn the trust of senior leaders, and influence their thinking on key strategic decisions
Have experience building and reviewing highly complex models, and developing a team that sets the gold standard for financial modeling. You know how to distill complex financial data into digestible outputs and analyses, for use across the organization
Are equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You dont hesitate to get in the weeds and work at the lowest level of detail, but youre just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team. No job is beneath you.
