Lead Cross-Functional Execution: Shepherd complex, multi-team integration projects from initial concept through launch and beyond. You will be deep in the details, wrangling backlogs, managing dependencies, identifying risks, and ensuring all teams (game, platform, publishing) are aligned on the goal.
Collaborate on Shared Ecosystems: Partner closely with the Ecosystem Product Manager on shared responsibilities such as console certification, localization, regional launch capabilities, and beta programs, ensuring a cohesive player experience.
Mentor and Level Up the Team: Act as a subject matter expert on live operations and technical production, preparing the game team to the point where they are ready to hire and effectively manage dedicated Live Ops Producers and Release Managers post-launch.

Required Qualifications:

8+ years of experience in senior technical production, technical product management, or engineering leadership roles within the games industry.
You have shipped AAA games in a production or product leadership capacity on PC or console.
