Senior Product Data Manager
Product
Ebury London Office - Hybrid: 4 days in the office, 1 day working from home per week
Were hiring a Senior Product Data Manager to join our Atlas team, responsible for building the real-time data infrastructure that powers company data ingestion from external and internal data sources across Ebury. This is a foundational role focused on enabling event-driven products across domains through a scalable, high-integrity platform.
The Atlas platform will serve as Eburys central nervous system for aggregating and exposing third-party data sources from KYC, financial data credit bureaus to fraud, sanctions, and compliance intelligence - in a performant, event-based architecture. Your mission: enable all other teams at Ebury to act on this data in real-time.
This is a deeply technical role, ideal for someone who can translate infrastructure into product vision, evangelise usage across teams, and scale platform adoption through strong communication, prioritisation, and stakeholder management.
What youll do

Own the vision and roadmap for the Atlas platform: Define and prioritise the capabilities that make external data ingestion, processing, and consumption seamless across all Ebury teams.
Build for scale and real-time performance: Collaborate with architects and engineers to shape a resilient, low-latency, event-driven infrastructure built for compliance and business-critical use cases.
Act as a product evangelist: Drive adoption across product and engineering teams by clearly articulating the value, use cases, and integration paths of the Atlas platform.
Define internal user journeys: Understand the needs of downstream product teams (e.g. onboarding, risk, payments, sales intelligence) and ensure the platform delivers APIs, events, and contracts they can trust and build on.
Enable data-driven architecture: Ensure that third-party data is ingested in a consistent, versioned, and observable way, enabling traceability, auditability, and reusability.
Balance roadmap and service levels: Prioritise platform improvements, API consistency, reliability SLAs, and technical documentation to ensure smooth usage by other teams.
Collaborate deeply with engineering: Work alongside highly technical teams to scope, plan, and deliver infrastructure improvements, from protocol design to pub/sub messaging patterns and observability tooling.
Manage complexity and scale thoughtfully: As data sources and users grow, ensure Atlas remains extensible, secure, and efficient for a wide variety of domains and use cases.

What youll need

4+ years in product management with a strong technical focus-ideally in infrastructure, platform, or API products.
Deep expertise in event-driven architecture and distributed systems - you understand the principles behind loosely coupled services, asynchronous communication, and the trade-offs between consistency, latency, and throughput.
Hands-on familiarity with stream processing and pub/sub systems such as Kafka or equivalent technologies, with a clear understanding of how to design for durability, scalability, and observability.
Ability to deeply understand engineering constraints and trade-offs-and translate them into product decisions.
Excellent communicator: You can influence across teams, evangelise your product vision, and gain buy-in from technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Experience managing internal platform products or developer experience tools is a major plus.
Passionate about building tools that make other teams faster, safer, and more effective.
Experience working in a regulated industry (fintech, banking, healthcare) is a bonus, especially where data integrity and auditability matter.

Why Ebury?

Competitive Starting Salary with an annual discretionary bonus that truly rewards your performance from day one.

We are hiring a Product Manager to join our Compliance Operations product team, with a focus on improving and scaling the client journeys that sit at the heart of our risk and regulatory operations. This role is ideal for someone passionate about simplifying complex processes while maintaining rigorous standards for compliance, control, and customer experience.
You will work closely with a Staff Product Manager to accelerate the global rollout of our next-generation compliance and onboarding platforms. Your work will directly impact how we onboard clients, manage authorised contacts, and perform periodic reviews - key journeys for our regulated business.
This is a high-ownership role at the intersection of operations, compliance, and technology. Youll partner with design, engineering, legal, and business stakeholders to reimagine critical compliance workflows that scale across regions and regulatory environments.
What youll do

Accelerate rollout in parallel streams: Work with the Staff PM to coordinate the staged delivery of compliance workflows across different regions and customer types, ensuring onboarding, ID&amp;V, and periodic reviews can be rolled out and completed independently but coherently.

Ensure completeness and accuracy: Deliver end-to-end ownership of initiatives like ID&amp;V rollout, ensuring technical implementation, stakeholder alignment, and operational readiness are all handled to a high standard.
Be technically thorough: Collaborate deeply with engineering on implementation details, APIs, edge cases, error handling, and data flows to ensure production-readiness for every workflow.
Drive operational efficiency: Identify manual, repetitive, or error-prone steps and work to automate or streamline them, reducing operational overhead and risk.
Translate rules into products: Convert compliance policy and internal processes into clean, executable workflows with built-in auditability and traceability.Collaborate across domains: Partner with legal, compliance, ops, engineering, and product teams to localise compliance flows and ensure platform readiness at scale.
Champion internal users: Ensure onboarding and CLM analysts have the intuitive, efficient tools they need to carry out compliance processes effectively and confidently.
Change Management: Effectively manage the introduction of new and updated products into the organisation and customer base

What youll need

35+ years of product management or operational product ownership experience, ideally in fintech, regtech, or complex B2B environments.
Strong analytical and systems thinking skills- you understand how rules, people, and systems interact across end-to-end journeys.
Experience working on regulated workflows (e.g. onboarding, KYC, AML, fraud detection, or case management) is a big plus.
Passion for streamlining operational workflows and understanding the jobs to be done of internal users.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity, breaking down complex processes into clear deliverables.
