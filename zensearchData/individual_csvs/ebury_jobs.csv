Ebury London Office - Hybrid: 4 days in the office, 1 day working from home per week
We are hiring a Product Manager to join our Compliance Operations product team, with a focus on improving and scaling the client journeys that sit at the heart of our risk and regulatory operations. This role is ideal for someone passionate about simplifying complex processes while maintaining rigorous standards for compliance, control, and customer experience.
You will work closely with a Staff Product Manager to accelerate the global rollout of our next-generation compliance and onboarding platforms. Your work will directly impact how we onboard clients, manage authorised contacts, and perform periodic reviews - key journeys for our regulated business.
This is a high-ownership role at the intersection of operations, compliance, and technology. Youll partner with design, engineering, legal, and business stakeholders to reimagine critical compliance workflows that scale across regions and regulatory environments.
What youll do

Accelerate rollout in parallel streams: Work with the Staff PM to coordinate the staged delivery of compliance workflows across different regions and customer types, ensuring onboarding, ID&amp;V, and periodic reviews can be rolled out and completed independently but coherently.

Ensure completeness and accuracy: Deliver end-to-end ownership of initiatives like ID&amp;V rollout, ensuring technical implementation, stakeholder alignment, and operational readiness are all handled to a high standard.
Be technically thorough: Collaborate deeply with engineering on implementation details, APIs, edge cases, error handling, and data flows to ensure production-readiness for every workflow.
Drive operational efficiency: Identify manual, repetitive, or error-prone steps and work to automate or streamline them, reducing operational overhead and risk.
Translate rules into products: Convert compliance policy and internal processes into clean, executable workflows with built-in auditability and traceability.Collaborate across domains: Partner with legal, compliance, ops, engineering, and product teams to localise compliance flows and ensure platform readiness at scale.
Champion internal users: Ensure onboarding and CLM analysts have the intuitive, efficient tools they need to carry out compliance processes effectively and confidently.
Change Management: Effectively manage the introduction of new and updated products into the organisation and customer base

What youll need

35+ years of product management or operational product ownership experience, ideally in fintech, regtech, or complex B2B environments.
Strong analytical and systems thinking skills- you understand how rules, people, and systems interact across end-to-end journeys.
Experience working on regulated workflows (e.g. onboarding, KYC, AML, fraud detection, or case management) is a big plus.
Passion for streamlining operational workflows and understanding the jobs to be done of internal users.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity, breaking down complex processes into clear deliverables.
Ability to align stakeholders and work cross-functionally across product, compliance, legal, engineering, and ops.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills- especially when writing user stories, documentation, or articulating regulatory logic.
Familiarity with Agile methodologies and experience working in iterative, fast-paced environments.
