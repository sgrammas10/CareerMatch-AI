The mission is focused on end-to-end orchestration and visibility, partnering with the right internal teams or external customers to make the required steps happen. What you get to do in this role  Track and report on status of migration requests from initial trigger to completion Take whatever steps are required to assign work items properly across teams, monitor for timeline execution, establish SLAs where needed.  This may include creating and assign change tasks for changes that track migration, checking for status updates, and hounding owners if SLAs are breached. Directly engage with customers to explain the migration process, build customer confidence in ability to execute, and push through customer resistance where needed to achieve our migration objectives. Directly engage with teams/systems outside of GCS where needed. Example: If an entitlement check is needed and not yet automated, do the check and talk with anyone required to do it properly. Be the process owner for how moves should be executed from an end-to-end perspective such that the group is positioned to provide automation requirements for areas that can be automated.  In this sense the vision of the group is that it starts as a group directly doing/owning manual steps to ensure a successful move.
