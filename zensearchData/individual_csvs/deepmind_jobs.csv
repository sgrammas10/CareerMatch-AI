We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.
About Us
The current paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) is largely ""one-size-fits-all"". While powerful, this approach fails to capture the diverse, implicit, and evolving preferences of individual users. A user's true intent is often revealed not in a single prompt, but over the course of a long, interactive conversation. The next frontier in AI is to move beyond static instruction-following and create models that dynamically learn and adapt to each user, personalizing their behavior to maximize helpfulness and satisfaction over the long term.
Our team is focused on this challenge: teaching Gemini to personalize itself through interaction. We frame this problem as a multi-turn, imperfect information game where the model must learn to infer a user's latent goals and preferences from conversational cues. Our aim is to leverage advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize for long-horizon user satisfaction, this involves tackling complex credit assignment problems in stateful, interactive environments.
The techniques you develop will have a direct impact on a wide range of Gemini applications like complex, multi-step tool use and agentic workflows.
Key responsibilities:

Design and implement novel multiturn RL algorithms to train personalized LLMs. This includes exploring advanced methods for credit assignment, exploration/exploitation strategies.
Develop and scale our training infrastructure, building on our existing framework for training against stateful user simulators.
Formalize the problem of personalization by creating new metrics, environments, and evaluation methodologies that capture long-term user satisfaction and preference alignment.
Collaborate closely with product teams to integrate these personalization capabilities into core Gemini products, improving tasks that require sustained interaction and user understanding.
Do cutting-edge research that pushes the boundaries of how agents learn from interactive, human-in-the-loop data

To make this effort successful, we need a strong RS who can help us deliver state-of-the-art personalized models. We are looking for a candidate with deep expertise in reinforcement learning and large-scale ML systems. You should be passionate about solving complex, long-horizon problems and excited by the challenge of building truly adaptive and intelligent agents.
About You
In order to set you up for success as a Research Scientist at DeepMind, we look for the following skills and experience:

PhD in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, or a related field.
Strong data analysis and synthetic data generation skills.
Strong development skills in Python and experience with deep learning frameworks like JAX, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
Experience building and working with large-scale ML training systems.

In addition, the following would be an advantage: 

Deep theoretical and practical experience in Reinforcement Learning (e.g., policy gradient methods, value-based methods, model-based RL, credit assignment).
Experience developing and training large generative models (LLMs).
Strong track record of academic publications in top-tier conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI).
Familiarity with research on game theory, multi-agent systems, or learning from human feedback (RLHF/RLAIF).
Experience building or using user simulators for RL training.

The VIVID team at Google DeepMind focuses on cutting-edge research to advance the capabilities of foundation models, to enable personalized, multimodal, and agentic experiences.
Our work spans new modeling approaches, problem definitions, and data, with a strong emphasis on the bridge between perceptual (audio, image, video) and semantic (language, code) modalities. In addition to producing highly-cited research published at top academic venues, our innovations land in flagship models like Gemini, and in Google products used by people every day.
About us

We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.
The role
We are seeking a highly motivated and talented Research Scientist to join our team at the forefront of multimodal large language model (LLM) research. You will work alongside a world-class team of researchers and engineers to develop and advance the next generation of AI models that can seamlessly integrate and reason across different modalities such as text, images, audio, and video.
Key responsibilities

Develop and implement next-generation agentic reasoning frameworks for multimodal understanding: This core responsibility involves moving beyond single-step inference to design models that can formulate complex plans, critique their own thought processes, and iteratively refine their conclusions. You will explore reinforcement learning (RL) to reward detailed reasoning chains, develop robust self-critique mechanisms for error correction, and integrate tool-use, enabling models to execute code for interactive video analysis and manipulation. Your work will directly address the project's goal of teaching models to solve problems that require deep, contextual reasoning over extended periods.
Pioneer the extension of visual reasoning from 2D into the 3D domain, enabling a more physically-grounded form of intelligence: Your research will focus on empowering models like Gemini to not just perceive 2D images and videos, but to infer and construct coherent 3D representations of the world from them. You will then leverage this deep spatial understanding to develop novel generative capabilities, such as synthesizing photorealistic views of a scene from new perspectives or allowing for the interactive modification of 3D objects and layouts. This frontier research is crucial for unlocking future applications in robotics, mixed reality, and creating agents that can truly reason about and interact with their physical environment.
Spearhead the creation of novel, challenging benchmarks to rigorously measure progress and define the future of visual reasoning: As models become more capable, existing benchmarks become insufficient. You will be responsible for identifying these gaps and leading the development of the next wave of evaluation datasets that test the limits of multimodal intelligence.

About you
