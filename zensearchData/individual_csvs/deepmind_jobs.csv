We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.
About Us
The current paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) is largely ""one-size-fits-all"". While powerful, this approach fails to capture the diverse, implicit, and evolving preferences of individual users. A user's true intent is often revealed not in a single prompt, but over the course of a long, interactive conversation. The next frontier in AI is to move beyond static instruction-following and create models that dynamically learn and adapt to each user, personalizing their behavior to maximize helpfulness and satisfaction over the long term.
Our team is focused on this challenge: teaching Gemini to personalize itself through interaction. We frame this problem as a multi-turn, imperfect information game where the model must learn to infer a user's latent goals and preferences from conversational cues. Our aim is to leverage advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize for long-horizon user satisfaction, this involves tackling complex credit assignment problems in stateful, interactive environments.
The techniques you develop will have a direct impact on a wide range of Gemini applications like complex, multi-step tool use and agentic workflows.
Key responsibilities:

Design and implement novel multiturn RL algorithms to train personalized LLMs. This includes exploring advanced methods for credit assignment, exploration/exploitation strategies.
Develop and scale our training infrastructure, building on our existing framework for training against stateful user simulators.
Formalize the problem of personalization by creating new metrics, environments, and evaluation methodologies that capture long-term user satisfaction and preference alignment.
Collaborate closely with product teams to integrate these personalization capabilities into core Gemini products, improving tasks that require sustained interaction and user understanding.
Do cutting-edge research that pushes the boundaries of how agents learn from interactive, human-in-the-loop data

To make this effort successful, we need a strong RS who can help us deliver state-of-the-art personalized models. We are looking for a candidate with deep expertise in reinforcement learning and large-scale ML systems. You should be passionate about solving complex, long-horizon problems and excited by the challenge of building truly adaptive and intelligent agents.
About You
In order to set you up for success as a Research Scientist at DeepMind, we look for the following skills and experience:

PhD in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, or a related field.
Strong data analysis and synthetic data generation skills.
Strong development skills in Python and experience with deep learning frameworks like JAX, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
Experience building and working with large-scale ML training systems.

In addition, the following would be an advantage: 

Deep theoretical and practical experience in Reinforcement Learning (e.g., policy gradient methods, value-based methods, model-based RL, credit assignment).
Experience developing and training large generative models (LLMs).
Strong track record of academic publications in top-tier conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI).
Familiarity with research on game theory, multi-agent systems, or learning from human feedback (RLHF/RLAIF).
Experience building or using user simulators for RL training.

About Us
AIs cyberattack capability is increasing rapidly; recently, there has been a surge in the number of zero-day exploits found by AI in well-tested software. However, fixing or hardening code often lags behind by months with human experts struggling to keep up with the long log of vulnerability reports. The danger is exacerbated by open-source models who are becoming more capable at cyberattack and are more readily available by malicious actors. The goal of our project is to leverage AI for the defense: (1) automatically fix discovered vulnerabilities and (2) harden code either through checked annotations or through transformations to safer coding practices in the same language.
Our team collaborates closely with a wide variety of teams across Google/Alphabet, leveraging Google DeepMinds expertise to deploy advanced machine learning algorithms with the goal of hardening code for Alphabet systems and beyond.
The Role
You will be developing an agent that leverages powerful AI models, compilers, runtimes, static/dynamic analyzers, and formal verification tools to harden code against a wide range of vulnerabilities across different programming languages and frameworks in collaboration with experts across these areas. As a part of the project, 

You will be rapid-prototyping initial concepts and designing and running experiments to achieve our goals.
Your work will be influential both in the research community and also in products that promise to have tremendous impact.

About You
We seek out individuals who thrive in ambiguity and who are willing to help out with whatever moves prototypes forward. We regularly need to invent novel solutions to problems, and at times change course if our ideas dont work out, so flexibility and adaptability to work is a must.
In order to set you up for success as a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind,  we look for the following skills and experience:

MSc or PhD/DPhil degree in Computer Science (or relevant majors), with emphasis on ML, or equivalent practical experience.

Strong, hands-on experience with LLMs (e.g., (RL) fine-tuning, inference, prompting, agent development).
Experience designing and developing evaluation benchmarks and implementing scalable evaluation pipelines.
Proven experience with prominent ML frameworks and tools.
Hands-on experience with AI-based code generation or editing tools.

In addition, the following would be an advantage: 

Experience with developer tools (compilers, runtimes, dynamic/static analyzers,  web frameworks, ... ).
Significant success with project(s) building AI tools for code, either as research publications at top PL/systems/AI venues, as an artifact developed at a company, or as open source artifact(s)
