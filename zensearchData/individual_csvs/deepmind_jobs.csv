You'll leverage our unique mix of expertise, data and computational resources to experiment and iterate both rapidly and at scale.
As a Research Scientist in Science, you will use your machine learning expertise to collaborate with domain experts and machine learning scientists to develop and run experiments exploring new applications of AI - particularly LLMs - to science problems. The team is pioneering in many different domains so you may take part in exploratory work validating early ideas or work in a maturing area to deepen and exploit a promising line of research. You may also contribute to the scientific knowledge and experience of the team with your own scientific domain knowledge. You will work with internal and external researchers on pioneering research bridging AI and science.
Key responsibilities:

Research the development and application of natural language LLMs for scientific problems.
Plan and perform rapid prototyping of large language model techniques applied to problems in science.
Engage with both underlying data sources (including diverse scientific text, figures, and multimodal data) and models.
Undertake exploratory analysis to inform experimentation and research directions.
Collaborate with researchers and machine learning engineers to identify and develop novel large language model approaches tailored to natural sciences.
Report and present research findings and developments (including status and results) clearly and efficiently both internally and externally, verbally and in writing.
Suggest and engage in team collaborations to meet research goals for the wider science program.

The role will suit candidates who enjoy working in a heavily experimental setting with large and noisy datasets and who wish to immerse themselves in innovative science, LLM, ML and AI research.
About You
In order to set you up for success as a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind,  we look for the following skills and experience:

PhD degree or equivalent experience in computer science, electrical engineering, natural science, or mathematics.

You are an experienced Machine Learning Engineer with a strong engineering and research background who is excited about improving safety and alignment of the ""Gemini"" end-user product, delivering state-of-the art language models to our users.
About us
Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanitys most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, were a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.
The role
Our team works on developing safe, aligned, and helpful Gemini models across all modalities (text, images, audio) as well as novel ways of evaluating them through superhuman autoraters or automated red teaming.
To that end, we are advancing the state-of-the-art on the entire post-training pipeline. This includes innovations in RLHF/RL*F tailored to safety and alignment, novel and scalable ways of evaluating models to find weaknesses, as well as improvements in model understanding to guide future research.
We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer excited to push the state of the art in these areas.
Key responsibilities

Apply and innovate on state-of-the-art modeling techniques with the goal of reducing safety violations while increasing human alignment using post-training approaches (e.g. SFT, RLHF/RL*F).
Collaborate with peers and cross-functional research teams on applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to LLM-based products.
Propose and quickly prototype novel ideas and implement advances in Gemini's production systems.
Have bias for action: our team operates in a high-reward and fast-paced environment.
In summary: we are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with strong intuition and the ability to drive ambiguous projects end-to-end to push the boundaries of Safety and Alignment on LLMs.

About you
In order to set you up for success as a machine learning-focused software engineer at Google DeepMind, we look for the following skills and experience:

MSc degree in computer science or machine learning or similar experience working in industry.
3+ years of experience with ML modeling and generative AI, working with data, model evaluations, and quality iterations.
Proven knowledge and experience of Python, one or several machine learning frameworks (Jax, TensorFlow, or PyTorch), as well as algorithms and data structures.
Ability to grow in high-stakes, high-visibility environments.

In addition, the following would be an advantage: 

PhD in Machine Learning or a related field.
Experience with training and optimizing large language models.

At Google DeepMind, we value diversity of experience, knowledge, backgrounds and perspectives and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact. We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis as protected by applicable law.
