We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.
Core Analytics Team: The Core Analytics Team (CAT) are a full stack data science team that organise, model, and deploy data to guide Google DeepMind strategy &amp; decisions. To do this we blend our technical skillset with rich stakeholder relationships.
The Role
We are looking for an experienced analytics engineer to build the data foundations, define key metrics and make recommendations to guide strategic decisions and influence the trajectory of AI research at Google DeepMind.
Some recent projects weve worked on:

Data Driven Investment Strategy: We built a model to estimate the time researchers were spending on each project based on the number of projects worked on and project role. We presented these insights to leaders of a large department to help them understand the investments theyd made in each research area. This allowed them to assess if the department was investing in the right areas.
Impact Measurement Strategy: Built an impact measurement strategy in partnership with a cross functional team. Defined a publication impact metric based on citation metadata. Built a pipeline to calculate this metric by ingesting public data on published papers and identifying ones published by Google DeepMind employees.
Enabled Unified Data Flow: Designed and implemented a new, scalable data pipeline to bridge the gap between two merged upstream tools. Collaborated with stakeholders to ensure the most effective solution was built.
Data Access Controls: Developed new technical methods to restrict sensitive data within dashboards while allowing users to view data relevant to them.
Inspire feature development: Working with partner teams to adjust their roadmap to ensure key data is collected to enhance downstream analytics.

What we can offer you:

Help Steer AI development: You will have the opportunity to contribute to the development of AI by providing recommendations to leaders of AI research teams.
Unparalleled Breadth of Analytics Experience: Unlike typical roles, you'll gain exposure to all facets of analytics, including data modeling, pipeline development, and presenting to senior stakeholders; equipping you with a diverse skill set crucial for career advancement.
Sharpen Communication Skills: This role involves presenting to and working closely with senior leaders, providing a platform to significantly develop your communication and presentation skills.

Be Part of a Great Team: You will be part of a strong and motivated team who work closely together to learn how to solve complex problems and develop new approaches.
About you
We're looking for an experienced analytics engineer with at least 4 years experience working in a data role (e.g. Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist or Data Analyst) who can translate complex business challenges into impactful data-driven solutions
Essential Skills:

Advanced Data Modelling in SQL: Experience designing, building, and optimizing data models in SQL. You understand the tradeoffs between different data structures and levels of data normalisation. You are an advanced SQL user who is confident in solving data problems that require multiple transformation steps.
