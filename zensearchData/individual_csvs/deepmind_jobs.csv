About Us
AIs cyberattack capability is increasing rapidly; recently, there has been a surge in the number of zero-day exploits found by AI in well-tested software. However, fixing or hardening code often lags behind by months with human experts struggling to keep up with the long log of vulnerability reports. The danger is exacerbated by open-source models who are becoming more capable at cyberattack and are more readily available by malicious actors. The goal of our project is to leverage AI for the defense: (1) automatically fix discovered vulnerabilities and (2) harden code either through checked annotations or through transformations to safer coding practices in the same language.
Our team collaborates closely with a wide variety of teams across Google/Alphabet, leveraging Google DeepMinds expertise to deploy advanced machine learning algorithms with the goal of hardening code for Alphabet systems and beyond.
The Role
You will be developing an agent that leverages powerful AI models, compilers, runtimes, static/dynamic analyzers, and formal verification tools to harden code against a wide range of vulnerabilities across different programming languages and frameworks in collaboration with experts across these areas.

Your work will be influential both in the research community and also in products that promise to have tremendous impact. 
You will be responsible for setting the research and engineering milestones,  and deliver them by working closely with other team members and teams.

About You
We seek out individuals who thrive in ambiguity and who are willing to help out with whatever moves prototypes forward. We regularly need to invent novel solutions to problems, and at times change course if our ideas dont work out, so flexibility and adaptability to work is a must.
In order to set you up for success as a Software Engineer at Google DeepMind,  we look for the following skills and experience:


MSc or PhD/DPhil degree in Computer Science (or relevant majors), with emphasis on Developer Tools or Program Analysis, or equivalent practical experience.
