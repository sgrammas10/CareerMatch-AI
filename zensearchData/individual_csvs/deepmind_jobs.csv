We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.
About Us
The current paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) is largely ""one-size-fits-all"". While powerful, this approach fails to capture the diverse, implicit, and evolving preferences of individual users. A user's true intent is often revealed not in a single prompt, but over the course of a long, interactive conversation. The next frontier in AI is to move beyond static instruction-following and create models that dynamically learn and adapt to each user, personalizing their behavior to maximize helpfulness and satisfaction over the long term.
Our team is focused on this challenge: teaching Gemini to personalize itself through interaction. We frame this problem as a multi-turn, imperfect information game where the model must learn to infer a user's latent goals and preferences from conversational cues. Our aim is to leverage advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize for long-horizon user satisfaction, this involves tackling complex credit assignment problems in stateful, interactive environments.
The techniques you develop will have a direct impact on a wide range of Gemini applications like complex, multi-step tool use and agentic workflows.
Key responsibilities:

Design and implement novel multiturn RL algorithms to train personalized LLMs. This includes exploring advanced methods for credit assignment, exploration/exploitation strategies.
Develop and scale our training infrastructure, building on our existing framework for training against stateful user simulators.
Formalize the problem of personalization by creating new metrics, environments, and evaluation methodologies that capture long-term user satisfaction and preference alignment.
Collaborate closely with product teams to integrate these personalization capabilities into core Gemini products, improving tasks that require sustained interaction and user understanding.
Do cutting-edge research that pushes the boundaries of how agents learn from interactive, human-in-the-loop data

To make this effort successful, we need a strong RS who can help us deliver state-of-the-art personalized models. We are looking for a candidate with deep expertise in reinforcement learning and large-scale ML systems. You should be passionate about solving complex, long-horizon problems and excited by the challenge of building truly adaptive and intelligent agents.
