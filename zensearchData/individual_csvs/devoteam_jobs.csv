Another strategy role, another deck, another transformational roadmap with recommendations that never see the light of day. Sound familiar? If thats what youre after, this isnt for you.Were currently looking for a Lead Strategy Consultant who doesnt just want to think about the future but actually wants to shape it. Someone whos done their time in a consulting house or an in-house strategy team, learned the game, and is now itching to play it differently.At Devoteam, we live where strategy meets technology, and not in the lets add a blockchain slide way. We work at the intersection of AI, emerging tech, and business, helping companies not just adapt, but lead. Our clients dont come to us for conventional answers. They come to build the future.That is where you come in! Our Strategy, Experience and Innovation team is looking for bright minds to help us scale our work with some of the largest companies in the Nordics and the world. Be it Energy, Manufacturing, Transportation, Telco, Retail or other industries, we support our clients in partnership with the leading technology companies such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, ServiceNow, Google and some of the brands that are on their way to join these guys.Who We Are:Think former consultants, AI enthusiasts, design gurus, and corporate veteransall from different industries, universities, and career paths (plus a few unexpected ones in between). We debate, we question, we celebrate every perspectivebecause real innovation thrives on diversity. Who You Are:Youve got 3 - 4 years of dedicated consulting/strategy experience (consulting firms or in-house consulting) - enough to know the frameworks, top-down thinking and structured problem solving but are not trapped by them.You are passionate about and get tech, AI, and innovation - maybe not as a coder, but as someone who sees how it changes the game.Youre obsessively curious. You dont wait for someone to tell you whats next - youre already five steps ahead.You dont just analyze; you challenge, create, and execute. Youre the one asking the tough questions in the room, not just taking notes.You love solving problems that dont have Google-able answers - and you love exploring AI tools to elevate your work, but not to do the thinking for you.You want to work with people who challenge you, not just nod along.What Youll Do:Shape the future of AI, emerging tech, and digital business through bespoke tools and frameworks - strategy here isnt abstract; its a launchpad for real execution.Work directly with decision-makers who arent afraid to act on big ideas.Dive deep into new markets, new business models, and new technologies - then figure out how they actually support and grow organisations.Push boundaries - whether its redefining industries or inventing something that doesnt exist yet.Why Us?No corporate nonsense. Just smart people and nerds solving hard problems in a way that actually makes a difference.A front-row seat to the tech revolution. You wont just be talking about AI - youll be part of making it valuable and leading the work on the cases that everyone else will talk about.Speed, impact, ownership and learning. Your ideas wont gather dust; theyll face rigorous testing and get built or put down (nicely, of course!).A team that gets it. No egos, no red tape - just a shared drive to do cool things that matter, at speed.Whats Next?If this sounds like your kind of place, lets talk. Send us something - your CV, a video, your best idea, some code, game illustration or even just a note on why this excites you. We dont care about cover letter formalities - just show us how you think.This isnt just another strategy gig. Its your chance to build whats next.Ready?"
