Building on this infrastructure, we are now introducing financial services to help our users pay, save and borrow digitally. Helping usher the continent into a digital economy era. Were not just about serving people - were about creating a marketplace to bring people what they need while infusing social values.IntroductionThe Tech organization in Yassir is applying engineering and product best practices - to operate efficiently and build secured, efficient and user-friendly products and services - that can scale and be platformized across different business domains. Weve identified one area that can provide both tech excellence and business impact: authentication of users across our products and offerings.  The desired state of Authentication is one of a central, secure, efficient and scalable, initially for 1st party web and native applications, and later - for untrusted 3rd parties.Central authentication is one of the core competencies of a tech company, which is not measured by ROI or other financial/business matrices. It is measured by product and engineering metrics, such as login conversion rate, # of accounts creation, # of security incidents, etc. Central authentication could pave the way for our own digital identity platform and IDP.Identity Provider (IDP)Identity platform will allow Yassir to be a leading identity provider (IDP) in its region, offering frictionless and secured access to sites, apps and tools, including portability of data and digital assets, such as digital wallet, loyalty wallet, historical transactions, personal information (e.g. home address, birthdate, medical history), etc.   Creation, management and storage of digital identities is the key to providing said services, and therefore it is essential that Yassir will rely on its own identity stack and solutions, rather than relying on 3rd party providers. Provisioning of on-demand services, payments, banking and financial services - all require accurate and secured representation of people, businesses and organizations, which is done through an IDP that is designed to the specificities of our region and users.Becoming a leading Identity provider will especially enable the expansion and domination of our neo-bank offerings. Central AuthenticationCentral authentication is at the heart of digital identity services and it could be part of a future IDP platform.Central authentication allows end-users to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user ID and password) only once. It allows Yassir to build, maintain and evolve one central and unified authentication authority and ensure its security, efficiency and functionality, for 1st party clients, and in the future - also to 3rd parties. Authentication Team The authentication solutions need to be built and evolved by a dedicated team that will operate independently from the existing teams, to ensure an agnostic solution that can be abstracted and scaled. Product Manager Role &amp; ResponsibilitiesThe PM will work alongside the engineering lead to analyze the current state of authentication in the company, including existing authentication systems, components, practices and dependencies. In addition:Collect and analyze the requirements of a new central authentication solution that will replace existing ones, and the signup/login flows.  Assess industry standards, protocols and specifications to support the technical implementation, including comparable solutions and off-the-shelf products. Lead collaboration initiatives across the company, to ensure alignment on scope, timelines and operating model; and execution thereof. Define and monitor performance, KPIs and health metrics. Develop a digital identity vision and strategy that goes beyond central authentication.  Manage the day-to-day routines, including agile ceremonies, backlog management, project and program management, OKRs, etc. Requirements :- At least 6 years of experience and min 3 years in Product Management- Technical background and demonstrated experience preferred as the topic is very technical.- Business acumen to define the long-term vision for identity and authentication.Hiring Process: TA CallHiring Manager InterviewCase Study  PresentationLeadership Interview with Head of ProductAt Yassir, we believe in the power of diversity and the importance of an inclusive culture.
