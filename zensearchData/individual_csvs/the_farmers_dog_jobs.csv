What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
Whats a day in the life of a Software Engineer like here? Youll work with a talented engineering pawd to expand and improve our subscription-based, direct-to-consumer, e-commerce platform that delivers fresh food to pets across the country. Big fan of short feedback loops? Youll deliver high quality, well-tested and peer-reviewed code to production in minutes using our automated CI/CD pipeline. Your solutions will leverage industry best practices including A/B experiments, feature toggles and canary rollouts to confidently release high-impact features that dog lovers will love.
At The Farmers Dog collaboration is an imperative. Our team is full of engineers that love to learn and grow. Youll regularly white board, pair program and review architecture with top-notch peers with experience working at Amazon, Google, Disney, and Apple.
We have a great team, but theres still so much to do and figure out. If youre interested in scale and want to be in the room when those architecture decisions are made: youre reading the right job description. Were in that sweet spot of having clear product-market fit, but still having a small enough team that each engineer makes a big impact. Youll work closely with the team to restructure our application architecture to handle our rapid growth at scale.
If you want to have the space and agency to make a big impact both for customers, colleagues and our system: The Farmers Dog is for you. If youre looking for a fully-formed organization with a lot of established processes: a larger company would be a better fit. If youre looking for rapid iteration to find product-market fit: an earlier stage startup would be a better match.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

The Farmers Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. Were starting by radically improving the ninety billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer   to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.

What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
Whats a day in the life of a Software Engineer like here? Youll work with a talented engineering pawd to expand and improve our subscription-based, direct-to-consumer, e-commerce platform that delivers fresh food to pets across the country. Big fan of short feedback loops? Youll deliver high quality, well-tested and peer-reviewed code to production in minutes using our automated CI/CD pipeline. Your solutions will leverage industry best practices including A/B experiments, feature toggles and canary rollouts to confidently release high-impact features that dog lovers will love.
At The Farmers Dog collaboration is an imperative. Our team is full of engineers that love to learn and grow. Youll regularly white board, pair program and review architecture with top-notch peers with experience working at Amazon, Google, Disney, and Apple.
We have a great team, but theres still so much to do and figure out. If youre interested in scale and want to be in the room when those architecture decisions are made: youre reading the right job description. Were in that sweet spot of having clear product-market fit, but still having a small enough team that each engineer makes a big impact. Youll work closely with the team to restructure our application architecture to handle our rapid growth at scale.
If you want to have the space and agency to make a big impact both for customers, colleagues and our system: The Farmers Dog is for you. If youre looking for a fully-formed organization with a lot of established processes: a larger company would be a better fit. If youre looking for rapid iteration to find product-market fit: an earlier stage startup would be a better match.

Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.

What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
Were seeking a Process Engineer with a focus on new process development and process control to deliver exceptional manufacturing performance and a strong competitive advantage. With equal parts innovation and continuous improvement mindset, this person will be an important contributor in the R&amp;D organization.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
Were looking for a thoughtful, strategic, and highly collaborative Director of Corporate Development to join our team. This individual will be responsible for identifying, evaluating, and executing M&amp;A opportunities, partnerships, and strategic initiatives to help shape the long-term future of The Farmers Dog.
This role is equal parts strategist and operator. One day you might be crafting a long-range growth plan or modeling a potential partnership; the next youre synthesizing insights into a board presentation or aligning cross-functional teams on priorities. Youll bring clarity to complexity, keep us oriented around the most important questions, and help us think boldly about what comes next.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

Our IT group takes pride in representing and interfacing with the entire organization. Were looking for an IT Helpdesk Technician to help expand our internal IT capabilities and ensure our technology runs seamlessly. Youll work closely with employees across the organization to troubleshoot and resolve daily technology issues.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly.

This is a high-impact role that requires a highly motivated individual with a passion for EDI, supply chain and cross functional collaboration.

We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.

We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now?

We think that a small, but creative and free team can accomplish more than a large, bloated, unconstrained, bureaucratic one. We are accelerating our pace of innovation and are making substantial industry-changing new disruptions that will continue to improve the lives of millions of pets, pet owners, and pet care professionals.
A design note: design can change the world, and leading with the experience is at the heart of our product strategy and vision. Design is an act of co-creation that facilitates our understanding through continuous prototyping and customer feedback loops. We believe in intentionally shipping high-quality experiences rather than running experiments to see what sticks. The details are not the details. They inspire trust and make customers fall in love with our product.
A financial note: we are not waiting for a magical moment in the future to be sustainable. We are fiscally prudent, and we have never bitten more than we could chew. We have raised over $150MM where others have deployed more than a billion to reach a similar size.
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
As a Staff Product Designer, youll set the creative and strategic vision for some of our most ambitious new initiatives in the pet health space. Youll translate deep customer insight into intuitive, high-performing experiences that flex across contexts, driving both user joy and measurable business impact.
This role is perfect for a systems thinker and craft-obsessed designer who thrives on end-to-end ownership: from shaping adaptive, personalized experiences to guiding a consistent design language that scales. Youll lead by example, shaping the work, championing design systems, and exploring new tools (including AI workflows) that help us build smarter and faster.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
How You'll Make An Impact

What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
At The Farmers Dog, we believe great technology should make work easier, not harderand youll be at the center of bringing that to life. As the Manager, HRIS and Humans Technology, youll lead the daily administration and continuous improvement of Workdayour core HRIS platformwhile supporting the broader Humans technology ecosystem.
Youll drive the hands-on execution of system enhancements, ensuring Workday stays accurate, efficient, and people-centered as we scale. Youll own our HRIS service delivery modelmanaging intake, prioritization, and sprint planningand work side-by-side with internal partners to streamline workflows, expand self-service, and unlock better experiences for employees and managers.
You'll also manage and coach a small but mighty HRIS function (currently one HRIS Analyst), building technical skills and fostering a mindset of continuous improvement. And youll collaborate closely with People Analytics, IT, and other Humans functions to help execute our broader tech roadmap with a solution-oriented, customer-first approach.
This role reports to the Director, People Operations and plays a key role in helping our systems and data grow stronger, smarter, and more scalable as our business continues to expand.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.

We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly.

The Farmers Dog is the fastest growing pet health service company in the US, and was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care  a fresh proposition in an industry riddled with manipulative and misleading marketing. Were starting by radically improving the $100 billion pet food market, replacing bulk bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends healthy, freshly-made dog food, balanced by top veterinary nutritionists, directly to customers doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, honest, and delightful experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic and forward-thinking culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future. 
To date, The Farmers Dog has delivered hundreds of millions of meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to our customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.

What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
We have big ambitions, our mission is to give dog lovers true peace of mind by helping them do the best for their dogs  this will require us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change.

Youll have the opportunity to take the foundation we have in place today and evolve it to deliver on our customer promise to turn unconditional love into uncomplicated care. 
What do we believe is important to achieve those goals?

At The Farmers Dog, we believe this is a false choice, whats good for our customers and their dogs can and should also help us build a healthy business. To that end, we talk to customers every day  we sit in interviews, shadow customer service agents, use our own product, and use every form of data available to us to inform ways to improve our customers experience.

To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
Where youll come in: Prioritize your time for impact. Create the right touchpoints, feedback loops, organizational interfaces to make impactful decisions quickly.  Create a culture that thrives in delivering value and iterations on a daily basis.

How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
