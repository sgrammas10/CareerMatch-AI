The Farmers Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. Were starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.
To date, The Farmers Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.
#LongLiveDogs
What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
We have big, ambitious goals. Our mission is to give dog lovers true peace of mind by helping them do the best for their dogs  this will require us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates.
Thats why were looking for a highly innovative, strategic, and principles-driven Director of Influencer and Partnerships to lead efforts for The Farmers Dog, taking our programs to unimagined levels of efficiency, sustainability, and scale.
The Director of Influencer and Partnerships plays a vital role in our mission by owning programs aimed at finding, developing, and partnering with advocates of The Farmers Dog across a variety of strategies and sources.  This includes but is not limited to affiliates, influencers, and large strategic partnerships with organizations, celebrities, brands and entities. This person is excellent at prioritization, negotiation, and establishing lenses of measurement so that they and their team can triangulate and build hypotheses on impact and efficacy of efforts holistically. The Director of Influencer &amp; Partnerships has a diverse background in Growth Marketing and has successfully integrated partnerships of various structures and sizes into the core channel mix. 
You should be intuitively holistic in your approach, an excellent communicator, and hyper-focused on driving maximum business impact today and over time. Youll have the opportunity to take the foundation we have in place (including an existing team of high-performing operators) and evolve it to establish The Farmers Dog as the leading trusted pet care brand and the best option for dogs.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
How You'll Make An Impact
One of the amazing things about not subscribing to the traditional and classic definitions of roles is that we expect you to have an active hand in shaping this role and what youll focus on. The below is meant to be an illustrative list of the kinds of initiatives you might work on, but its not meant to be comprehensive nor prescriptive.

Lead and develop a high-impact team responsible for scaling and improving our existing partnerships portfolio. You are excellent at leading through others, have high expectations, are direct and empathetic with feedback, and are eager to continuously surpass our goals and re-define best-in-class.
Drive sustainable growth in Influencer, Affiliate, and Partnerships, ensuring we invest responsibly yet boldly, leveraging innovative strategies to meet an evolving customer base in the right place, at the right time, with the right message. Balance short term impact with long term growth. Model and communicate the value and impact of all initiatives for effective prioritization.
Bring thought-leadership to the department overall, because you know that no interaction exists in a silo and everything works together and therefore you have perspective and opinions on just about every channel and initiative across the customer journey.
Champion a thorough experimentation culture within your function that balances and includes incremental building and big bets. OKRs are designed with this mindset.
Build a data-guided and high decision-quality culture. Both individually and collectively dive deep in our data (which includes talking to customers &amp; leads often) to uncover insights that allow us to methodically remove friction from the experience across key customer segments and expedite movement through the pre-checkout portion of this journey.
You are recognized as an excellent person to partner with externally - because you operate with the highest levels of integrity, are very direct and have high expectations for partners yet are always fair and collaborative.  People want to work with you.  This includes excellent negotiation skills.

We're Excited About You Because
There is no single background or set of experiences that were beholden to. Confident you could drive impact in the areas outlined above? Apply and let us know why. The below is the kind of backgrounds were most excited about currently.

You have demonstrated your ability to build, negotiate, manage, and scale many Influencer, affiliate, and brand partnerships. Youve done this in a bold, holistic, and customer-focused manner. Youve used your hands-on experience to design and execute holistic, innovative, effective strategies.
You are an exceptional people manager. You expect a lot, but you support your team along the way. You empower your reports and create cultures and ceremonies/feedback loops so that everyone can and should operate with autonomy. You encourage feedback and debate from your function and across all levels. You are passionate about developing talent.
You lead through others - you dont need to be the one to do all the things to have an outsized impact, and your impact should be felt across the entire organization.
You have demonstrated excellent intuition yet are also analytical, and can tell a story from a set of data.  There are clear examples of opportunity identification and pattern matching in your career. This could be experience in data analytics/insights, media, scaling businesses, and/or other entrepreneurial endeavors. You should be excited about using those skill sets to improve our operations.
You are a maximizer - you continue to set the bar higher for yourself and those you work and partner with.
You thrive in high pressure, high stakes environments. You have natural drive and you work hard. You maintain early stage startup intensity at any scale.
Youre not afraid to disagree, and yet you can also comfortably admit when you were wrong.
You are skeptical, peek around corners effectively and continuously, and you are right the first time most of the time.

About The Growth Team
We have five principles that describe our approach:

Holistic thinking: We know that nothing exists in a silo.
Disciplined prioritization: We need to bring perspective, clarity and guidance to the team.

As an organization we are full of individuals who are unique in many ways, but all united in a mission of providing true peace of mind to dog lovers everywhere. Fixing this industry and improving the lives of pets and their people will be a difficult, decades-long endeavor. We believe the best use of our time, energy, and resources as a collective team is to focus on this mission, and on supporting our team to do their best work and be their best selves. In support of this were committed to supporting a diverse workforce, and investing in internal structures, opportunities, and training that create and sustain an inclusive team. We strive to provide an experience at TFD that will be invested, meaningful and memorable as we progress on the journey to reimagine how we feed and care for our pets.

Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

#LongLiveDogs
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
Whats a day in the life of a Software Engineer like here? Youll work with a talented engineering pawd to expand and improve our subscription-based, direct-to-consumer, e-commerce platform that delivers fresh food to pets across the country. Big fan of short feedback loops? Youll deliver high quality, well-tested and peer-reviewed code to production in minutes using our automated CI/CD pipeline. Your solutions will leverage industry best practices including A/B experiments, feature toggles and canary rollouts to confidently release high-impact features that dog lovers will love.
At The Farmers Dog collaboration is an imperative. Our team is full of engineers that love to learn and grow. Youll regularly white board, pair program and review architecture with top-notch peers with experience working at Amazon, Google, Disney, and Apple.
We have a great team, but theres still so much to do and figure out. If youre interested in scale and want to be in the room when those architecture decisions are made: youre reading the right job description. Were in that sweet spot of having clear product-market fit, but still having a small enough team that each engineer makes a big impact. Youll work closely with the team to restructure our application architecture to handle our rapid growth at scale.
If you want to have the space and agency to make a big impact both for customers, colleagues and our system: The Farmers Dog is for you. If youre looking for a fully-formed organization with a lot of established processes: a larger company would be a better fit. If youre looking for rapid iteration to find product-market fit: an earlier stage startup would be a better match.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now?

We have big ambitions, our mission is to give dog lovers true peace of mind by helping them do the best for their dogs  this will require us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates.
Thats why were looking for a highly innovative, strategic, and principles-driven Head of Offline Marketing to lead our Video and Offline efforts for The Farmers Dog, taking our programs to unimagined levels of efficiency, sustainability, and scale.
Head of Offline Marketing plays a vital role in our mission by ensuring our investments in Big Screen Video (TV and CTV), Audio (Radio, Podcast and Streaming), Print (Direct Mail and Inserts) and OOH (Out of Home) drive measurable and sustainable long-term growth for The Farmers Dog by effectively introducing us and building connection with novel audiences. Reporting into our Head of Media, your job will be to use all resources at your disposal (cross-functional partners, data, research, capital, etc) to significantly innovate and scale our large, cross-channel broadcasting media program. You should be intuitively holistic in your approach, an excellent communicator, and hyper-focused on driving maximum business impact overtime. Youll have the opportunity to take the foundation we have in place (including an existing team of high-performing operators) and evolve it to establish The Farmers Dog as the leading trusted pet care brand and the best option for dogs.

How You'll Make An Impact
One of the amazing things about not subscribing to the traditional and classic definitions of roles is that we expect you to have an active hand in shaping this role and what youll focus on. The below is meant to be an illustrative list of the kinds of initiatives you might work on, but its not meant to be comprehensive nor prescriptive.

Lead and develop a high-impact team responsible for scaling and improving our Big Screen Video, Audio, Print and OOH (non-exhaustive mix) channel performance. You are excellent at leading through others, have high expectations, are direct and empathetic with feedback, and are eager to continuously surpass our goals and continuously re-define best-in-class.
Drive sustainable scale of our big screen video and reach based media, ensuring we invest responsibly across Linear TV, CTV, and Audio channels with tactics that could include Local TV, National Cable, Broadcast, Over The Air, Digi Network, Satellite, Programmatic Guaranteed, Price Guaranteed, PMP, etc, to introduce The Farmers Dog to new audiences who convert. Balance short term impact with long term growth. Model and communicate the value and impact of all initiatives for effective prioritization.  You focus on incrementality and audience impact.
Bring thought-leadership to the department overall, because you know that no interaction exists in a silo and everything works together and therefore you have perspective and opinions on just about every channel and initiative.  You also know that you dont know everything, and are open to different and new ways to think and approach problems. 
Champion a thorough experimentation culture within your function that balances and includes incremental building and big bets. OKRs are designed with this mindset and your experimentation roadmap and accountability to learning agendas is rigorous.
Build a data-driven and high decision-quality culture. Both individually and collectively dive deep in our data (including talking to customers &amp; leads) to uncover insights that allow us to methodically remove friction from the experience and speed up time to conversion across key customer segments.
Own our tooling  constantly work to evolve the tools that enable us to achieve our mission faster, whether thats tooling that we build internally or external tools developed by our partners.
Manage any and all relevant third-party relationships and contracts.

We're Excited About You Because
There is no single background or set of experiences that were beholden to. Confident you could drive impact in the areas outlined above? Apply and let us know why. The below is the kind of backgrounds were most excited about currently.

You have demonstrated your ability to build, negotiate, and manage Linear TV and CTV broadcast budgets at scale. Youve done this in a bold, holistic, and customer-focused manner. Youll use your hands-on experience with these channels to negotiate upfront and programmatic guaranteed deals with networks and design and execute a holistic, effective strategy.
You are an exceptional people manager. You expect a lot, but you support your team along the way. You empower your reports and create cultures and ceremonies/feedback loops so that everyone can and should operate with autonomy. You encourage feedback and debate from your function and across all levels. You are passionate about developing talent.
You lead through others - you dont need to be the one to do all the things to have an outsized impact, and your impact should be felt across the entire organization.
A highly analytical background with clear examples of opportunity identification and pattern matching. This could be experienced in data analytics/insights, media, scaling businesses, and/or other entrepreneurial endeavors. You should be excited about using those skill sets to improve our operations.
You are a maximizer - you continue to set the bar higher.
You thrive in high pressure, high stakes environments. You have natural drive and you work hard. You maintain early stage startup intensity at any scale.
Youre not afraid to disagree, and yet you can also comfortably admit when you were wrong.
You are skeptical, peek around corners effectively and continuously, and you are right the first time most of the time.

What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
The Senior Business Systems Specialist role is responsible for overseeing the successful implementation and adoption of our software solutions, ensuring seamless integration and adoption across the organization. You will lead cross-functional functions, manage project timelines, and drive communication so projects are delivered on time, within scope and meeting the needs of our stakeholders.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.

Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
Were looking for a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Coordinator to help us improve the end-to-end process behind how we automate communication with our prospective customers (leads) and evangelists through channels like email and SMS. You will assist in the day-to-day production, operations and deployment of a variety of acquisition based campaigns, including email campaigns to leads, vet professionals, and customers for our Referral program, to ensure we launch impactful marketing that drives meaningful, sustainable growth and help deliver peace of mind to our future customers via a seamless experience.
While embedded in Acquisition, you will take on the role of a deployment partner with a dotted line to our CRM function, and be responsible for coordinating all of the moving pieces for email (briefing, creative production, asset handoff, coding, campaign set-up, proofing, QA) between the Brand function, our 3rd party agencies, and the other CRM/Lifecycle members. You will also be responsible for analyzing campaign data, and developing insights to inform future strategic decisions. Your ultimate responsibility will be to ensure all relevant timelines are met and that every email &amp; or advertisement that makes its way to a prospective customer is mistake free, timely, and impactful.
This is a fantastic entry level opportunity for somebody whos keen to learn and/or advance their career in Growth Marketing! You have the opportunity to learn a lot about different channels and points in the customer decision journey, ultimately setting the foundation for a strategic, holistic, customer-centric approach to marketing.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
How You'll Make An Impact

We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates.

Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have the necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms to solve problems holistically.

To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now?

One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter.

We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now?

What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
We are looking for a highly motivated regulatory attorney to join our fast-growing legal team as Senior Counsel, Regulatory, who will manage the regulatory compliance issues across the organization, partner closely with our veterinary team and play an integral role as one of the core members of our Legal Department at The Farmers Dog. They will report to the General Counsel, and will work closely with stakeholders across the Company to manage the Companys day-to-day regulatory issues and compliance needs. The Senior Counsel is expected to further accelerate TFDs momentum through working with the business to efficiently and proactively identify ways to mitigate risk and eliminate legal blockers. This is a high-impact role perfect for a team player with a passion for law, and of course, dogs!
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
