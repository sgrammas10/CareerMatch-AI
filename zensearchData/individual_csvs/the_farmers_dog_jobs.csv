The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.
To date, The Farmers Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.
#LongLiveDogs
A tech note: technology has been and will continue to be at the core of how we are going to build the future above. We think that a small, but creative and free team can accomplish more than a large, bloated, unconstrained, bureaucratic one. We are accelerating our pace of innovation and are making substantial industry-changing new disruptions that will continue to improve the lives of millions of pets, pet owners, and pet care professionals.
A design note: design can change the world, and leading with the experience is at the heart of our product strategy and vision. Design is an act of co-creation that facilitates our understanding through continuous prototyping and customer feedback loops. We believe in intentionally shipping high-quality experiences rather than running experiments to see what sticks. The details are not the details. They inspire trust and make customers fall in love with our product.
A financial note: we are not waiting for a magical moment in the future to be sustainable. We are fiscally prudent, and we have never bitten more than we could chew. We have raised over $150MM where others have deployed more than a billion to reach a similar size.
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
You are a craftsperson at the highest level and someone other designers and partners seek out and learn from.
You'll make an immediate impact by elevating our design through your strong visual and interaction design skills. You'll be able to simplify complex concepts and develop designs that are easy to understand and foster trust in our product and service. As a design lead overseeing Acquisition, Sign-Up, and Onboarding ""pawds,"" you will educate users about the product and help them sign up for a service tailored to their dog's unique needs. You will connect strategy across different work streams, ensuring a holistic end-to-end experience.
You'll also lead our design system effort by establishing quality craftsmanship and working on developing our next-generation UI/UX. Your role is pivotal in implementing a strategy to move us towards our Northstar, and shaping the future of a category-defining product and user experience.
You lead by doing and approach every pixel and word on the screen with purpose. You also have the ability to simplify complex messaging and functionality into easy-to-understand, simple, and intuitive experiences.
You'll provide invaluable mentorship to other designers, helping elevate the team's skills in visual design and producing beautiful UI experiences. Additionally, you'll play a key role in contributing to our overall experience strategy and partner cross-functionally to ensure our experience is solving customer needs and optimized across all touchpoints. 
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
The Farmers Dog is looking for an Engineering Manager. The Engineering function is building a subscription e-commerce platform from the ground up to support hundreds of thousands of orders being shipped out every day. Were looking for an Engineering Manager  to provide development, coaching, and mentorship to our team; refine processes, and help with multi-functional management. 
This Engineering Manager will need to own performance management and ensure successful group development. Every day, this person will partner closely with Product Managers and Engineers to craft the product and improve processes while removing roadblocks and uncertainty.
Technologies we currently use are Node.js, JavaScript (we like newer ECMAScript a lot), TypeScript, AWS, Docker, Terraform, Postgres.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
How You'll Make An Impact

What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
We have big ambitions, our mission is to give dog lovers true peace of mind by helping them do the best for their dogs  this will require us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates. 
Thats why were looking for a highly analytical and principles-driven Lifecycle &amp; CRM Manager to holistically improve key moments in our customer experience. Reporting into our Director of Retention &amp; Customer Lifecycle, your job will be to use any and all of the resources available to you (internal groups, data, operational levers, tools, etc.) to improve the customer experience and drive life-long retention. Youll have the opportunity to take the foundation we have in place today and evolve it to deliver on our customer promise to turn unconditional love into uncomplicated care. 
What do we believe is important to achieve those goals?

We Love Our Customers: Many companies claim to be customer first or customer obsessed, but in reality its surface level proclamations where the first question is typically whats in it for us? not what can we do for our customers?. At The Farmers Dog, we believe this is a false choice, whats good for our customers and their dogs can and should also help us build a healthy business. To that end, we talk to customers every day  we sit in interviews, shadow customer service agents, use our own product, and use every form of data available to us to inform ways to improve our customers experience.
Where youll come in: Uplevel our customer decision making. Continue to foster a culture and develop a talent for routinely making excellent decisions on behalf of our customers and the business. 
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  our CRM group can write software requirements, our engineers recommend and implement changes to the customer lifecycle, our data analysts talk to customers and so on. We dont ask ourselves, what  am I supposed to be working on today?, we ask ourselves what can I do today to have the biggest impact on our customers possible?.
Where youll come in: Meaningfully improve customer retention. Use every resource, touchpoint, and opportunity available to you and the Team to meaningfully improve our customers lives and build a healthy business that will stand the test of time. 
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
Where youll come in: Prioritize your time for impact. Create the right touchpoints, feedback loops, organizational interfaces to make impactful decisions quickly.  Create a culture that thrives in delivering value and iterations on a daily basis.

The Farmers Dog is the fastest growing pet health service company in the US, and was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care  a fresh proposition in an industry riddled with manipulative and misleading marketing. Were starting by radically improving the $100 billion pet food market, replacing bulk bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends healthy, freshly-made dog food, balanced by top veterinary nutritionists, directly to customers doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, honest, and delightful experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic and forward-thinking culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.
To date, The Farmers Dog has delivered hundreds of millions of meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to our customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.

What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
Whats a day in the life of a Software Engineer like here? Youll work with a talented engineering pawd to expand and improve our subscription-based, direct-to-consumer, e-commerce platform that delivers fresh food to pets across the country. Big fan of short feedback loops? Youll deliver high quality, well-tested and peer-reviewed code to production in minutes using our automated CI/CD pipeline. Your solutions will leverage industry best practices including A/B experiments, feature toggles and canary rollouts to confidently release high-impact features that dog lovers will love.
At The Farmers Dog collaboration is an imperative. Our team is full of engineers that love to learn and grow. Youll regularly white board, pair program and review architecture with top-notch peers with experience working at Amazon, Google, Disney, and Apple.
We have a great team, but theres still so much to do and figure out. If youre interested in scale and want to be in the room when those architecture decisions are made: youre reading the right job description. Were in that sweet spot of having clear product-market fit, but still having a small enough team that each engineer makes a big impact. Youll work closely with the team to restructure our application architecture to handle our rapid growth at scale.
If you want to have the space and agency to make a big impact both for customers, colleagues and our system: The Farmers Dog is for you. If youre looking for a fully-formed organization with a lot of established processes: a larger company would be a better fit. If youre looking for rapid iteration to find product-market fit: an earlier stage startup would be a better match.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

#LongLiveDogs
What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
We have big ambitions, our mission requires us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates. 
Thats why were looking for an entrepreneurial, strategic, and customer-centric Category Lead, known for their drive in bringing innovative and effective business lines to life. This person will grow a burgeoning new product category for The Farmers Dog platform, design an effective growth strategy and R&amp;D roadmap, manage the P&amp;L to make top and bottom line decisions and craft and execute both longitudinal and A/B/C experiments to scale the business. This is a highly self motivated yet collaborative role. You should be able to be scrappy to make things happen on your own, but also collaborate with R&amp;D, finance, operations, acquisition, brand, product managers, engineering, design, CX and more. As such, your work will be diverse and across all stages of the product life cycle  youll have the opportunity to think big in blue-sky planning sessions as well as go deep with tactical implementation..
What do we believe is important to achieve those goals? Where do we expect you to have an impact?
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.
