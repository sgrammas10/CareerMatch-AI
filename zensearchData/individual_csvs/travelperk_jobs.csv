The Opportunity
TravelPerk is on a mission to redefine how companies manage travel and expense. But more than that, were creating a category that helps businesses eliminate the broken processes, and the complexity thats been accepted as normal for far too long.
We believe the future of work isnt just about productivity tools. Its about freedom. Clarity. Simplicity. And real work. That belief drives everything we do, from our product design to our brand expression. And now, were looking for a bold brand leader to help bring it to life at scale.
This is more than a brand role. Its a chance to lead the creation of a category, and build a global brand with the stature, swagger, and soul of a consumer icon, while driving growth in one of the most dynamic B2B markets out there.
Reporting to the VP of Marketing, youll:


Shape how the world sees TravelPerk


Define how we show up and embed brand thinking into every touchpoint (internally and externally)


Lead the largest brand awareness investment weve ever made


Lead an incredible group of senior leaders across brand, content, campaigns, and creative


Push boundaries, take risks, and make work that makes people feel something


Set the vision, drive operational excellence, and hold full accountability for the brand marketing budget, performance, and outcomes


Operate at the intersection of creativity, commercial impact, and executional rigour, scaling a brand thats not just known, but loved


 
Who You Are
Youre a B2B marketer with a B2C soul, who has a deep understanding of the US market. You know how to build trust with business leaders, but you dont believe business needs to be boring.


Youve led brands at fast-growing companies or worked agency-side with some of the worlds most ambitious brands


You bring creative stretch and operational discipline to every brief, and you know how to invest in brand at scale


Youve owned multi-million-dollar brand budgets, not just spent them, but strategically allocated them across channels, markets, and moments


Youre obsessed with performance, measuring brand impact, optimising investments, and proving value to the boardroom


Youve built brands for the US market, and you understand the nuance, tone, pace, and channels that work in this landscape


Youve activated partnerships, sponsorships, and influencer programmes that shape culture and drive attention


Youve led brand efforts where the ambition matched the scale: new category, global market, high-stakes growth


You thrive in global businesses, balancing consistency with local insight and building cross-functional alignment across regions and time zones


 
Why This Role, Why Now
Were at a pivotal point in our journey. The product is strong, the category is clear, and the appetite to build a standout brand is real across the entire exec team. Weve got the momentum. Weve got the investment. Now we need someone who can lead with vision, operate with discipline, and drive results.
This isnt a role for someone who wants to optimise what exists. Its for someone who wants to create what doesnt. Youve scaled brands globally, led large teams, managed eight-figure budgets, and made brand a board-level growth lever.
Now youre ready to do it again. Only bolder.
 
What Youll Bring


15+ years of experience in brand marketing, ideally with a blend of B2B and B2C


Deep experience building brands for US markets (required)


Comfortable owning and optimising large-scale brand budgets


Experience in brand measurement, reporting, and brand-health tracking


Experience working in or with creative agencies is a plus


Comfortable operating across time zones (our core team is Europe-based)


 
This is your chance to build something iconic. To break the mould. To leave your fingerprints on a brand that challenges convention and lights a fire under an entire industry.
This is a senior leadership role, not for someone whos run a few brand campaigns, but for a brand architect who has scaled a company, built global teams, and made brand a boardroom conversation.

Youll define the vision, shape the product architecture, and lead the team building the future of Spend &amp; Control at TravelPerk.

Spend &amp; Control (Expenses, Invoicing, Approvals): a $100 million ARR business with major product expansion and growth ahead


As SVP of Product  Spend &amp; Control, youll lead the full product suite and the broader platform that supports it. This includes user management, permissions, reporting, and cross-platform product architecture. Youll help TravelPerk evolve from best-in-class travel to a unified, end-to-end spend platform for modern businesses.

Own and evolve the Spend &amp; Control product vision, roadmap, and team


Integrate Yokoy into the TravelPerk stack to deliver a seamless, scalable experience


Define the architecture and user experience across travel and expense, supporting both unified and standalone use cases


Deliver advanced functionality across workflows, policy enforcement, roles and permissions, and reporting


Launch the integrated travel and expense experience within your first year


Build a highly configurable, mid-market-ready platform for companies ranging from 700 to 5,000 employees


Lead a cross-functional organisation of over 40 across product, design, and research, partnering with more than 150 engineers


Drive clarity and speed across the team, enabling product-led growth without compromising cohesion or usability


Collaborate closely with Engineering, Sales, and Customer teams to deliver solutions that scale


 
What were looking for


10+ years in senior product leadership, ideally in B2B SaaS, fintech, or workflow-driven platforms like CRM, ERP, or HRIS


Experience building and scaling configurable, platform-level products with strong adoption and engagement


A track record of leading mid-sized product teams (20+ in product/design, 100+ in engineering)


Deep understanding of workflow design, policy logic, reporting frameworks, and access control


Proven success delivering for mid-market customers (typically 700 to 5,000 employees)


Strong architectural thinking combined with attention to detail and user experience


Confidence navigating complex platform integrations and driving technical evolution

Partner closely with Engineering and Supply to deliver high-impact technical and commercial improvements


Build and lead high-performing teams with clear goals, strong ownership, and consistent delivery


 
What were looking for


10+ years in senior product leadership roles (VP/SVP level), ideally in travel tech or high-scale marketplace platforms


Strong technical fluency, especially across transactional systems, APIs, and automation


A track record of leading large product organisations (30+ in product/design, 100+ in engineering)
