Hear more about TravelPerk. When structuring our team we like to focus on the objectives to be achieved, not the function. Your objective as our Senior Event Specialist will be to get our teams together in a meaningful and impactful way. 
You will be part of the team who owns anything that has to do with company and team events: budget, process, planning, communications, execution, tracking data, feedback... An event for us is anything that gets our teams together: from a team lunch to a 2-day-long company offsite or a meeting between our colleagues in the Birmingham hub. Organizing some of these will just require you to set up an easy process so that teams can book on their own, while some other events will require a very active involvement in planning and executing.

Strategic thinking: be able to act quickly for events that come up from nowhere but also be able to think in the long-term and plan the events for the whole year.
Able to manage events that are in other locations (in any of our hubs), remote events or hybrid events.
