Where will the role take you?
We believe passionately in the importance of growth and development for lawyers; and that every lawyer is entitled to a job from which they derive high levels of personal satisfaction. Talented and driven people are entitled to expect employers to offer an employee value proposition which offers continual levelling up.  
A successful occupant of this role will, after a suitable period of time, have exceptional experience of working in a fast scaling, global tech (and specifically SaaS) business. He or she will develop the tools and techniques to deliver internal privacy capability at scale which subverts the expectations of stakeholders regarding privacy and AI governance laws (i.e. that it is bureaucracy) and drives tangible business outcomes.  
In terms of promotions, the next layer up from Junior Privacy &amp; AI Counsel is Privacy &amp; AI Counsel. We are not hiring in this layer currently, and do not expect to hire over the head of this role; instead, we are looking for this person to grow and scale capability in their areas of expertise (and among legal subject matter experts who interact with other legal and privacy roles). TravelPerk will offer you as much latitude as you want in order to deliver the best possible outcomes for your customers; and micromanagement or layers of bureaucracy are not part of that process.
The winning candidate will benefit from a competitive salary, stock options and a positive, high impact not long hours culture.

Hear more about TravelPerk.  
The Opportunity
TravelPerk is on a mission to redefine how companies manage travel and expense. But more than that, were creating a category that helps businesses eliminate the broken processes, and the complexity thats been accepted as normal for far too long.
We believe the future of work isnt just about productivity tools. Its about freedom. Clarity. Simplicity. And real work. That belief drives everything we do, from our product design to our brand expression. And now, were looking for a bold brand leader to help bring it to life at scale.
This is more than a brand role. Its a chance to lead the creation of a category, and build a global brand with the stature, swagger, and soul of a consumer icon, while driving growth in one of the most dynamic B2B markets out there.
Reporting to the VP of Marketing, youll:


Shape how the world sees TravelPerk


Define how we show up and embed brand thinking into every touchpoint (internally and externally)


Lead the largest brand awareness investment weve ever made


Lead an incredible group of senior leaders across brand, content, campaigns, and creative


Push boundaries, take risks, and make work that makes people feel something


Set the vision, drive operational excellence, and hold full accountability for the brand marketing budget, performance, and outcomes


Operate at the intersection of creativity, commercial impact, and executional rigour, scaling a brand thats not just known, but loved


 
Who You Are
Youre a B2B marketer with a B2C soul, who has a deep understanding of the US market. You know how to build trust with business leaders, but you dont believe business needs to be boring.


Youve led brands at fast-growing companies or worked agency-side with some of the worlds most ambitious brands


You bring creative stretch and operational discipline to every brief, and you know how to invest in brand at scale


Youve owned multi-million-dollar brand budgets, not just spent them, but strategically allocated them across channels, markets, and moments


Youre obsessed with performance, measuring brand impact, optimising investments, and proving value to the boardroom


Youve built brands for the US market, and you understand the nuance, tone, pace, and channels that work in this landscape


Youve activated partnerships, sponsorships, and influencer programmes that shape culture and drive attention


Youve led brand efforts where the ambition matched the scale: new category, global market, high-stakes growth


You thrive in global businesses, balancing consistency with local insight and building cross-functional alignment across regions and time zones


 
Why This Role, Why Now

Weve got the investment. Now we need someone who can lead with vision, operate with discipline, and drive results.
This isnt a role for someone who wants to optimise what exists. Its for someone who wants to create what doesnt. Youve scaled brands globally, led large teams, managed eight-figure budgets, and made brand a board-level growth lever.
Now youre ready to do it again. Only bolder.
 
What Youll Bring


15+ years of experience in brand marketing, ideally with a blend of B2B and B2C


Deep experience building brands for US markets (required)


Comfortable owning and optimising large-scale brand budgets


Experience in brand measurement, reporting, and brand-health tracking


Experience working in or with creative agencies is a plus


Comfortable operating across time zones (our core team is Europe-based)


 
This is your chance to build something iconic. To break the mould. To leave your fingerprints on a brand that challenges convention and lights a fire under an entire industry.
This is a senior leadership role, not for someone whos run a few brand campaigns, but for a brand architect who has scaled a company, built global teams, and made brand a boardroom conversation.
