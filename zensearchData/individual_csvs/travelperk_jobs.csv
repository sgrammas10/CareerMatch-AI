These are just some of the reasons why global brands like Wise, Red Bull, GetYourGuide, and Aesop trust us to get the most out of their travel.
Hear more about TravelPerk. When structuring our team we like to focus on the objectives to be achieved, not the function. Your objective as our Senior Event Specialist will be to get our teams together in a meaningful and impactful way. 
You will be part of the team who owns anything that has to do with company and team events: budget, process, planning, communications, execution, tracking data, feedback... An event for us is anything that gets our teams together: from a team lunch to a 2-day-long company offsite or a meeting between our colleagues in the Birmingham hub. Organizing some of these will just require you to set up an easy process so that teams can book on their own, while some other events will require a very active involvement in planning and executing.
Were looking for someone who has a strong experience and skills to manage the current challenges, but who is also looking to grow, experiment and challenge our approach towards getting together
What you will do...

Strategic thinking: be able to act quickly for events that come up from nowhere but also be able to think in the long-term and plan the events for the whole year.

Leading development, brainstorming, design, event creation, and communications for all-employee gatherings.

Handle budgeting and invoicing
Source, liaise, and negotiate with vendors
Oversee logistics and ensure smooth operations
Share updates with management
Manage communication with stakeholders
Lead or assist with event content creation
Provide aftercare (answering questions and comments)
Attend events when necessary
Develop event feedback surveys
Coordinate all event operations
Supervise staff (event coordinators, caterers, etc.) if applicable
Ensure smooth event completion and resolve any issues that arise
Analyze event success and prepare reports


What we look for...

3+ years in events management for a &gt; 300 employees company (tech or startup company is a plus).
Strong English communication skills (written and verbal). Advanced Spanish is a plus (written and verbal).
Team player. We're not joking here. We need top class collaborators.
Humble: youre ok with the spotlight, but you dont crave it. You know what you dont know and youre willing to learn.
Extreme Ownership + Getting things done attitude

Exceptional organizational abilities, superb interpersonal skills, multi-tasking and prioritization skills, attention to detail and excellent time-management.
Proactive approach and able to work under pressure. Look for problems to solve before they become problems. But when they become problems, stay cool and solve them quickly.
Extremely hands-on: you don't mind solving small problems or big problems. From high-level planning to detailed execution.


Project Management skills


Define, Plan and Oversee projects so that they are delivered faster than anyone would think possible
Constantly update the relevant people
Get your hands dirty and build
Lead and rally people to Community initiatives


Stakeholder management: people come to you because you make their lives easier and solve problems for them. However, you are able to say NO when necessary, even if it means not pleasing everyone. We have a very special way of doing things in the Community team at TravelPerk. We build with the members of our Community, not for them.

Advise managers and manage expectations.
Build a strong internal network.
You will help managers structure their budget to make sure they cover all the needs throughout the year without overspending.
Never a blocker or bottleneck: you will empower them to autonomously lead and take ownership of their get togethers with your support.

Adaptability and flexibility; with our fast-paced environment change comes all the time. This role will evolve with time and as the company scales, different needs will emerge. You must possess a genuine hunger to navigate your role in a fast-changing, hyper-growth environment
You feel comfortable constantly challenging and being challenged, learning fast, making things happen, and moving from one project to the next one.
 
On Top Of Traditional Event Management, You Will Also

Culture focus: you will always have TravelPerks culture in mind when doing everything you do. As part of the Community team you will live and breathe our values and always put these first.
You will be innovative:

Constantly search for new ways to make an impact through events and get togethers.
Increase the engagement strategy, creative approach, planning, and execution for the largest events.
Organize and identify opportunities to improve TravelPerkers experience, providing strategic guidance for new programs, events, and other experiences


Have a strong data approach: evaluate and measure event success in new ways and leverage those learnings in the development of our strategy.
Management skills: If the team grows in the future, you should be able to hire and manage a team to support you.
Continuous improvement is part of your DNA. The bar is high but you always aim to set it higher. You keep abreast of news and updates to keep yourself informed and the company to the highest standards.
You seek feedback early and often and are open to constructive and direct criticism
Ready to roll-up your sleeves and work hard.
And of course, have fun doing what you do!
