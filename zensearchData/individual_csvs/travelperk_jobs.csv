About the role
Were looking for a visionary and analytical Head of Insights to launch and lead TravelPerks first insights function - transforming data into stories that spark attention, build trust, and shape the conversation around business travel, expense management, and the future of work.
This is a rare opportunity to build something from the ground up. Youll blend the curiosity of a researcher with the voice of a storyteller - mining trends from our product and platform data, commissioning original research, and publishing content that sets the agenda in our industry.
We want to be bold. We want to be useful. And we want to be talked about. This role sits at the heart of that ambition.
 
What youll do

Build a new function. Design and launch a brand insights capability that powers our thought leadership, content strategy, PR and campaign messaging.
Create standout content. Deliver original, data-led stories - from single powerful charts to long-form reports and sharp opinion pieces - that elevate our brand and point of view.
Leverage proprietary data. Work closely with our data teams to uncover trends in travel behaviour, expense policy, and the modern workplace using TravelPerks platform data.
Commission research. Identify gaps and lead third-party surveys or market studies to deepen and validate our insights.
Drive rhythm and relevance. Establish a publishing cadence that builds familiarity and anticipation with our target audience (e.g. weekly, monthly, quarterly drops).
Work across the business. Partner with the wider team across marketing, product, finance and data team to design to align insights with go-to-market efforts and campaign calendars.
Measure what matters. Define and track success through reach, engagement, share of voice, and audience growth - not short-term lead metrics.

 
What Were Looking For

Proven experience in a senior brand insights, research-led content, or strategic thought leadership role - ideally within B2B SaaS, fintech, media, or professional services.
A portfolio that shows you can turn data into stories that inform, surprise and resonate - whether through visuals, reports, or narrative content.
Confident with data - comfortable briefing analysts, digging into dashboards, or interpreting trends. (SQL or BI tools a plus, but not essential.)
Strong editorial and storytelling instincts with a sharp eye for what makes content valuable and shareable.
Skilled at collaborating across marketing, product, finance, data and comms - and able to work independently when needed.
A bias for action and experimentation. Youre not waiting for the perfect dataset - youre out to find whats interesting and get it in front of the right people.
Curious about business travel, finance, tech, and the cultural shifts shaping how we work.

 
Our Benefits

 A competitive compensation package, including equity in TravelPerk;
 Generous vacation days so you can rest and recharge;
