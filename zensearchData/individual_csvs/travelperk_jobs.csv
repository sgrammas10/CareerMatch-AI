Excellent communication and interpersonal skills for collaborating with cross-functional teams and the ability to present and articulate concepts and solutions clearly.
Proficiency in Figma and the Adobe Creative Suite is essential.

About the role
We're looking for a visionary Content Strategist to build and lead TravelPerk's first insights function. This is a unique opportunity to transform our rich product and platform data into compelling stories that capture attention, build trust, and shape the conversation around business travel and expense management.
This role is for a natural storyteller with a strong bias for data-led content  someone comfortable spotting trends and uncovering the untold stories hidden behind the data from our platform.

Strong Editorial Judgment: A sharp eye for what makes content newsworthy, valuable, and shareable, with the ability to say ""no"" to obvious or uninteresting narratives. You write with personality and edge, avoiding corporate or dry language.
Strategic Thinker: Understands how insights can serve as a lever for brand reputation, market positioning, and C-suite engagement.
Bias for Action &amp; Experimentation: You're proactive in finding interesting stories, thrive on being resourceful, and are comfortable publishing frequently with a focus on momentum over perfection.
