About the role
At TravelPerk, weve always believed business travel could be better: easier, faster, more human. So we built a category-leading platform to prove it.
Now were raising the bar again.
Marketplace is the engine behind TravelPerk. With over $200 million in annual revenue, it powers every booking, every traveller, and every partner integration  from flights and hotels to rail, car hire, inventory systems, APIs, and post-booking automation. But its more than infrastructure. Marketplace is how we deliver flexibility, choice, and innovation to customers at scale. Its central to our growth and the foundation for everything were building next.
To lead this chapter, were hiring a Senior Vice President of Product, Marketplace. Youll own the strategy, execution, and team across our entire travel stack. This isnt a greenfield build. Its a mature, high-scale platform that already works. Now it needs to move faster, operate more efficiently, and meet a new level of reliability and performance.
This is a builders role, but not in the traditional sense. You wont be starting from zero. Youll be scaling a complex product to new levels of maturity, automation, and trust. Youll raise the bar for technical quality, team execution, and customer experience. And youll do it all with clarity, intensity, and deep product leadership.
 
Why this role matters
TravelPerk now operates two core business units:


Marketplace (Travel): a $200 million ARR platform powering millions of trips and billions in transactions


Spend &amp; Control (Expenses, Invoicing, Approvals): a fast-growing $100 million ARR business with major product expansion underway


As SVP of Product  Marketplace, youll lead the entire travel domain: supply integrations, vertical product experiences (flights, hotels, rail, car rental), post-booking flows, APIs, automation layers, and our growing ecosystem of third-party partner integrations.
Marketplace is not just a feature. It is the foundation. It powers our scale and supports the experiences customers rely on every day. This role is critical to TravelPerks growth, operational stability, and strategic positioning.
 
What youll do


Own and evolve the Marketplace product vision, roadmap, and team


Lead a cross-functional organisation of around 60 across product, design, and research, partnering closely with over 200 engineers


Manage a high-scale, mature product suite across flights, hotels, rail, and car rental


Increase system speed, scalability, and platform reliability to support continued growth


Scale our inventory connectivity across NDC, GDS, and direct integrations


Drive automation across post-booking experiences and operational workflows


Expand our integrations Marketplace, enabling customers to connect HR, payments, expense, and sustainability tools into their travel workflows


Partner closely with Engineering and Supply to deliver high-impact technical and commercial improvements


Build and lead high-performing teams with clear goals, strong ownership, and consistent delivery


 
What were looking for


10+ years in senior product leadership roles (VP/SVP level), ideally in travel tech or high-scale marketplace platforms


Strong technical fluency, especially across transactional systems, APIs, and automation


A track record of leading large product organisations (30+ in product/design, 100+ in engineering)


Comfort operating in complex, high-volume environments with operational pressure and scale


Proven ability to raise the bar across uneven teams and drive strong execution quickly


Experience scaling platform layers, connectivity, or partner ecosystems


A clear, confident communicator who brings focus, energy, and urgency to the team


 
Why now? Why you?
Marketplace is already a $200 million business. But it is nowhere near done.
There is a team in place. There is volume. There is demand. What we need now is leadership. Someone who can turn Marketplace into a world-class product organisation  reliable, focused, and high-performing.
This is a rare opportunity to lead one of the most strategic areas of our product at true scale, with full executive backing and visibility. Youll work with smart, ambitious people. Youll take on tough technical and operational challenges. And youll help shape the future of business travel, every day.
If that sounds like the right kind of challenge, wed love to meet you!
