Hear more about TravelPerk.  
The Opportunity
TravelPerk is on a mission to redefine how companies manage travel and expense. But more than that, were creating a category that helps businesses eliminate the broken processes, and the complexity thats been accepted as normal for far too long.
We believe the future of work isnt just about productivity tools. Its about freedom. Clarity. Simplicity. And real work. That belief drives everything we do, from our product design to our brand expression. And now, were looking for a bold brand leader to help bring it to life at scale.
This is more than a brand role. Its a chance to lead the creation of a category, and build a global brand with the stature, swagger, and soul of a consumer icon, while driving growth in one of the most dynamic B2B markets out there.
Reporting to the VP of Marketing, youll:


Shape how the world sees TravelPerk


Define how we show up and embed brand thinking into every touchpoint (internally and externally)


Lead the largest brand awareness investment weve ever made


Lead an incredible group of senior leaders across brand, content, campaigns, and creative


Push boundaries, take risks, and make work that makes people feel something


Set the vision, drive operational excellence, and hold full accountability for the brand marketing budget, performance, and outcomes


Operate at the intersection of creativity, commercial impact, and executional rigour, scaling a brand thats not just known, but loved


 
Who You Are
Youre a B2B marketer with a B2C soul, who has a deep understanding of the US market. You know how to build trust with business leaders, but you dont believe business needs to be boring.


Youve led brands at fast-growing companies or worked agency-side with some of the worlds most ambitious brands


You bring creative stretch and operational discipline to every brief, and you know how to invest in brand at scale


Youve owned multi-million-dollar brand budgets, not just spent them, but strategically allocated them across channels, markets, and moments


Youre obsessed with performance, measuring brand impact, optimising investments, and proving value to the boardroom


Youve built brands for the US market, and you understand the nuance, tone, pace, and channels that work in this landscape


Youve activated partnerships, sponsorships, and influencer programmes that shape culture and drive attention


Youve led brand efforts where the ambition matched the scale: new category, global market, high-stakes growth


You thrive in global businesses, balancing consistency with local insight and building cross-functional alignment across regions and time zones


 
Why This Role, Why Now
Were at a pivotal point in our journey. The product is strong, the category is clear, and the appetite to build a standout brand is real across the entire exec team. Weve got the momentum. Weve got the investment. Now we need someone who can lead with vision, operate with discipline, and drive results.
This isnt a role for someone who wants to optimise what exists. Its for someone who wants to create what doesnt. Youve scaled brands globally, led large teams, managed eight-figure budgets, and made brand a board-level growth lever.
Now youre ready to do it again. Only bolder.
 
What Youll Bring


15+ years of experience in brand marketing, ideally with a blend of B2B and B2C


Deep experience building brands for US markets (required)


Comfortable owning and optimising large-scale brand budgets


Experience in brand measurement, reporting, and brand-health tracking


Experience working in or with creative agencies is a plus


Comfortable operating across time zones (our core team is Europe-based)


 
This is your chance to build something iconic. To break the mould. To leave your fingerprints on a brand that challenges convention and lights a fire under an entire industry.
This is a senior leadership role, not for someone whos run a few brand campaigns, but for a brand architect who has scaled a company, built global teams, and made brand a boardroom conversation.

This is more than a brand role. Its a chance to lead the creation of a category, and build a global brand with the stature, swagger, and soul of a consumer icon, while driving growth in one of the most dynamic B2B markets out there.
Reporting to the VP of Marketing, youll:


Shape how the world sees TravelPerk


Define how we show up and embed brand thinking into every touchpoint (internally and externally)


Lead the largest brand awareness investment weve ever made


Lead an incredible group of senior leaders across brand, content, campaigns, and creative


Push boundaries, take risks, and make work that makes people feel something


Set the vision, drive operational excellence, and hold full accountability for the brand marketing budget, performance, and outcomes


Operate at the intersection of creativity, commercial impact, and executional rigour, scaling a brand thats not just known, but loved


 
Who You Are
Youre a B2B marketer with a B2C soul, who has a deep understanding of the US market. You know how to build trust with business leaders, but you dont believe business needs to be boring.


Youve led brands at fast-growing companies or worked agency-side with some of the worlds most ambitious brands


You bring creative stretch and operational discipline to every brief, and you know how to invest in brand at scale


Youve owned multi-million-dollar brand budgets, not just spent them, but strategically allocated them across channels, markets, and moments


Youre obsessed with performance, measuring brand impact, optimising investments, and proving value to the boardroom


Youve built brands for the US market, and you understand the nuance, tone, pace, and channels that work in this landscape


Youve activated partnerships, sponsorships, and influencer programmes that shape culture and drive attention


Youve led brand efforts where the ambition matched the scale: new category, global market, high-stakes growth


You thrive in global businesses, balancing consistency with local insight and building cross-functional alignment across regions and time zones


 
Why This Role, Why Now
Were at a pivotal point in our journey. The product is strong, the category is clear, and the appetite to build a standout brand is real across the entire exec team. Weve got the momentum. Weve got the investment. Now we need someone who can lead with vision, operate with discipline, and drive results.
This isnt a role for someone who wants to optimise what exists. Its for someone who wants to create what doesnt. Youve scaled brands globally, led large teams, managed eight-figure budgets, and made brand a board-level growth lever.
Now youre ready to do it again. Only bolder.
 
What Youll Bring


15+ years of experience in brand marketing, ideally with a blend of B2B and B2C


Deep experience building brands for US markets (required)


Comfortable owning and optimising large-scale brand budgets


Experience in brand measurement, reporting, and brand-health tracking


Experience working in or with creative agencies is a plus


Comfortable operating across time zones (our core team is Europe-based)


 
This is your chance to build something iconic. To break the mould. To leave your fingerprints on a brand that challenges convention and lights a fire under an entire industry.
This is a senior leadership role, not for someone whos run a few brand campaigns, but for a brand architect who has scaled a company, built global teams, and made brand a boardroom conversation.

About the role
At TravelPerk, weve always believed business travel could be better: easier, faster, more human. So we built a category-leading platform to prove it.
Now were going one step further.
With the acquisition of Yokoy, weve added world-class expense automation and spend management to our product. Weve moved beyond travel. Now were rebuilding how companies manage spend from the ground up.
To lead this transformation, weve created a new role: Vice President of Product  Spend &amp; Control. This is one of the most important product leadership hires well make this year. Reporting to our new CPO, youll define the vision, shape the product architecture, and lead the team building the future of Spend &amp; Control at TravelPerk.
This is not a maintenance role. Its a builders challenge, with scale, ownership, and the rare opportunity to shape something new from within an existing foundation.

Spend &amp; Control (Expenses, Invoicing, Approvals): a $100 million ARR business with major product expansion and growth ahead


As VP of Product  Spend &amp; Control, youll lead the full product suite and the broader platform that supports it.

Deliver advanced functionality across workflows, policy enforcement, roles and permissions, and reporting


Launch the integrated travel and expense experience within your first year


Build a highly configurable, mid-market-ready platform for companies ranging from 700 to 5,000 employees


Lead a cross-functional organisation of over 40 across product, design, and research, partnering with more than 150 engineers


Drive clarity and speed across the team, enabling product-led growth without compromising cohesion or usability


Collaborate closely with Engineering, Sales, and Customer teams to deliver solutions that scale


 
What were looking for


10+ years in senior product leadership, ideally in B2B SaaS, fintech, or workflow-driven platforms like CRM, ERP, or HRIS


Experience building and scaling configurable, platform-level products with strong adoption and engagement


A track record of leading mid-sized product teams (20+ in product/design, 100+ in engineering)


Deep understanding of workflow design, policy logic, reporting frameworks, and access control


Proven success delivering for mid-market customers (typically 700 to 5,000 employees)


Strong architectural thinking combined with attention to detail and user experience


Confidence navigating complex platform integrations and driving technical evolution


 
Why now? Why you?
Youve built platforms. Youve launched complex products. Youve scaled high-performing teams. You bring clarity to complexity, and now youre ready for a new challenge.
This is a rare opportunity to take ownership of a product area that is still being shaped. Youll have scale, momentum, and full executive support behind you. Youll work with smart, driven people, solve difficult problems, and help shape a platform used by thousands of companies.
Were growing fast, building ambitiously, and moving with purpose. The foundations are in place. Now we need a product leader who can take us forward.

About the role
At TravelPerk, weve always believed business travel could be better: easier, faster, more human. So we built a category-leading platform to prove it.
Now were raising the bar again.
Marketplace is the engine behind TravelPerk. With over $200 million in annual revenue, it powers every booking, every traveller, and every partner integration  from flights and hotels to rail, car hire, inventory systems, APIs, and post-booking automation. But its more than infrastructure. Marketplace is how we deliver flexibility, choice, and innovation to customers at scale. Its central to our growth and the foundation for everything were building next.
To lead this chapter, were hiring a Vice President of Product, Marketplace. Reporting to our new CPO, youll own the strategy, execution, and team across our entire travel stack. This isnt a greenfield build. Its a mature, high-scale platform that already works. Now it needs to move faster, operate more efficiently, and meet a new level of reliability and performance.
This is a builders role, but not in the traditional sense. You wont be starting from zero. Youll be scaling a complex product to new levels of maturity, automation, and trust. Youll raise the bar for technical quality, team execution, and customer experience. And youll do it all with clarity, intensity, and deep product leadership.

Lead a cross-functional organisation of around 60 across product, design, and research, partnering closely with over 200 engineers


Manage a high-scale, mature product suite across flights, hotels, rail, and car rental


Increase system speed, scalability, and platform reliability to support continued growth


Scale our inventory connectivity across NDC, GDS, and direct integrations


Drive automation across post-booking experiences and operational workflows


Expand our integrations Marketplace, enabling customers to connect HR, payments, expense, and sustainability tools into their travel workflows


Partner closely with Engineering and Supply to deliver high-impact technical and commercial improvements


Build and lead high-performing teams with clear goals, strong ownership, and consistent delivery


 
What were looking for


10+ years in senior product leadership roles (Director/VP level), ideally in travel tech or high-scale marketplace platforms


Strong technical fluency, especially across transactional systems, APIs, and automation


A track record of leading large product organisations (30+ in product/design, 100+ in engineering)


Comfort operating in complex, high-volume environments with operational pressure and scale


Proven ability to raise the bar across uneven teams and drive strong execution quickly


Experience scaling platform layers, connectivity, or partner ecosystems


A clear, confident communicator who brings focus, energy, and urgency to the team
