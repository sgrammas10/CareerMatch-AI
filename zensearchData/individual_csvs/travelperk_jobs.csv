We're looking for a visionary Content Strategist to build and lead TravelPerk's first insights function. This is a unique opportunity to transform our rich product and platform data into compelling stories that capture attention, build trust, and shape the conversation around business travel and expense management.
This role is for a natural storyteller with a strong bias for data-led content  someone comfortable spotting trends and uncovering the untold stories hidden behind the data from our platform.

What youll do

Launch a New Function: Design and implement a brand insights capability that fuels our thought leadership, content strategy, PR, and campaign content.
Create Standout, Data-Led Content: Produce original stories, from powerful charts and short-form reactive pieces to long-form reports and sharp opinion articles, that elevate our brand and point of view. This role is fundamentally a content role that requires strong data skills.
Leverage Proprietary Data: Collaborate closely with our data teams to identify trends in travel and spend behaviour using TravelPerks platform data. You'll be comfortable digging into dashboards and interpreting trends.

Proven Content &amp; Storytelling Expertise: A strong portfolio demonstrating your ability to transform complex data into clear, human, informative, and engaging stories that resonate with a B2B audience, especially finance leaders.
Data Savvy: Confident in interpreting data, comfortable extracting insights from dashboards or spreadsheets, and capable of working independently with data. Familiarity with SQL or BI tools is a plus, but not essential.
Strong Editorial Judgment: A sharp eye for what makes content newsworthy, valuable, and shareable, with the ability to say ""no"" to obvious or uninteresting narratives. You write with personality and edge, avoiding corporate or dry language.
Strategic Thinker: Understands how insights can serve as a lever for brand reputation, market positioning, and C-suite engagement.
Bias for Action &amp; Experimentation: You're proactive in finding interesting stories, thrive on being resourceful, and are comfortable publishing frequently with a focus on momentum over perfection.
Collaborative &amp; Influential: Skilled at working across various teams (marketing, product, finance, data, and comms) and influencing stakeholders, while also being capable of independent work.
Curious &amp; Connected: Deeply interested in business travel, finance, tech, and the cultural shifts shaping the modern workplace. You're plugged into macro trends like inflation, financial agility, and market shifts.
