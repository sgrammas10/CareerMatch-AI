We're looking for a data systems pioneer to build our entire data ecosystem from scratch with the executive backing and autonomy to make it happen.The Vision: Imagine a central data platform that ingests real-time IoT data from industrial inspections to predict equipment failures, or unifies decades of lab results to optimise entire supply chains. You'll build this analytics engine and the high-performance, real-time data backends for our most critical products. If you're excited by the challenge of turning messy, complex, real-world data into fast, reliable products, this is your role. 
As a Principal Data Engineer, you will own the flow of data across our organization. Your dual mission is to: 1) Engineer a central, world-class analytics engine that provides clean, trustworthy data for AI and business intelligence. 2) Architect and build the data-intensive backends for our flagship products, selecting the right tools to ensure low-latency and high-reliability.What You'll Build and OwnArchitect Product Data Layers: Design the data models and select the optimal persistence technologies (e.g., PostgreSQL, NoSQL, Time-Series DBs) for new, high-throughput digital products.Build the Core Analytics Engine: Engineer our core data platform using modern tools like dbt, Spark, and cloud warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks) to create a single source of truth.Develop High-Performance Pipelines: Build and operate robust, observable data pipelines for both massive batch processing and low-latency, real-time streams (e.g., using Kafka, Flink).Harvest &amp; Generalize Data Patterns: Identify common data challenges and solutions, packaging them into reusable pipelines, modules, and best practices for other teams to leverage.Champion Data Quality: Implement and promote a strong data quality culture using modern frameworks (e.g., Great Expectations) to ensure our data is always trustworthy.Grow the Foundation: As the first Principal on the team, you will play a key role in shaping our technical culture and mentoring future hires as we build out the data engineering function. Data Platforms &amp; Warehousing: Deep expertise in modern cloud data platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks (Delta Lake).Data Processing &amp; Transformation: Expert-level proficiency with Apache Spark (PySpark/Scala) and modern data transformation tools, especially dbt.Application Data Architecture: Proven experience designing data models for transactional systems. Hands-on experience with PostgreSQL is essential; experience with NoSQL or Time-Series DBs is a strong plus.Streaming &amp; Orchestration: Hands-on experience with workflow orchestration (Airflow, Dagster) and real-time streaming technologies (Kafka, Flink).Programming &amp; SQL: Expert-level SQL and strong programming skills in Python or Scala for data engineering.Who You AreYou are a pragmatic data systems builder with extensive (8+ years) of experience.You have a proven track record of turning complex, messy data into reliable, high-performance products and platforms.You thrive on greenfield challenges and have architected major data systems from the ground up. You are a pragmatist who can balance the needs of large-scale analytics with the low-latency demands of user-facing applications.You are obsessed with data quality and building systems that are both powerful and trustworthy.
