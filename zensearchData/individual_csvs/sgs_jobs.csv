Die zich specifiek bevinden in de Antwerpse, Zeebrugse of Limburgse haven. Door je werk zorg je zo persoonlijk mee voor de veiligheid van de klant, zijn werknemers en jouw collegas.Je opleiding is gericht op het behalen van verschillende kwalificaties welke uitgesplitst worden naar type installatie en soort inspectie (conformiteitscontroles of periodieke keuringen). Slaag je voor een kwalificatieproef dan zal je van onze dienst planning zelfstandige opdrachten krijgen.Je vertrekt van thuis uit naar je klanten en voert daar de verschillende aangevraagde inspecties uit en maakt hiervan een duidelijk digitaal rapport. Desgevallend, ben je ook in staat om te motiveren aan de klant waarom je een bepaalde installatie negatief beoordeelt. Je bouwt m.a.w. een gedegen kennis op van de bestaande geldende wetgeving.In het begin zal je zowel opleiding volgen als zelfstandig werken, dit totdat je alle nodige kwalificaties hebt behaald. Je teamleader bekijkt samen met jou het traject dat binnen jouw mogelijkheden haalbaar is.Bij SGS werk je in een team (je collegas, teamleader en de collega's van de technische cel) waar je steeds terecht kunt voor hulp en/of uitleg.Je rapporteert rechtstreeks aan de teamleader van Vlaanderen.Je bent in het bezit van een bachelor diploma: Elektriciteit, Elektrotechnieken, Elektromechanica of gelijkwaardig door ervaring.
 Je hebt oog voor operationele veiligheid; bewust omgaan met de voorziene PBMs en hier een voorbeeldgedrag in stellen naar zowel de klant als de collegas; dit is n van de belangrijke keystones van SGS.
 Je werkgebied is vooral geconcentreerd in de havengebieden in Belgi, desgevallend kunnen er andere inspecties ingepland worden die een wat verdere verplaatsing vereisen. Je deinst er dan ook niet van terug om veel verplaatsingen te doen en kan om met fileleed.
 Je bent eventueel bereid om ook offshore inspecties uit te voeren.
 Je houdt van zelfstandig werken en bezit een groot verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel.
 Je bent leergierig en blijft graag op de hoogte van de evoluties in de technische wetgeving.
 Je bent communicatief en klantgericht, zeker wanneer de installatie van de klant niet aan de wetgeving voldoet.
 Je hebt zin voor kwaliteit en oog voor detail, dit weerspiegelt zich niet alleen in je werk on site maar ook in de rapporten die je opmaakt.
 Je spreekt en schrijft perfect Nederlands, kennis van extra talen is een pluspunt.Ons aanbod:

Binnen SGS kan je rekenen op een verantwoordelijke functie, een tof team van collegas en een aantrekkelijk salarispakket (ref. PC219) helemaal aangepast aan jouw kennis en ervaring (denk aan firmawagen, laptop, dagvergoeding, groepsverzekering, etc...)Herken je jezelf in dit profiel?

Strong skills in a language like Go, Python, or TypeScript.Observability: A practical, hands-on approach to building an observability stack (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger) that provides actionable insights, not just dashboards.Who You AreYou have extensive (e.g., 8+ years) experience and identify as a builder first, with a background in SRE, Platform Engineering, or senior Software Engineering.You are a pragmatist who hates bureaucracy and believes the best architecture is the simplest one that works.You measure your success by the velocity and autonomy of the engineers you support.You love getting your hands dirty and leading from the front.What We OfferTop-of-Market Compensation: A highly competitive salary and bonus package for Madrid, designed to attract and retain premier talent for this strategic role. A Clear Growth Path: This role offers a direct path to technical leadership and the opportunity to build and mentor a team around your architectural vision. A Compelling Mission: Build the platform that will run the AI and Data products that have a real-world impact on global safety, sustainability, and supply chains. Foundational Impact: You will be the first Principal Platform Engineer in our new Digital Hub, setting the standards for how a global leader builds and ships software. Greenfield Ownership &amp; Autonomy: This is not about maintaining legacy systems. You have a mandate to build our entire cloud-native platform from scratch, backed by C-level sponsorship."
