In de functie van Calibration Technician ben jij verantwoordelijk voor het organiseren en plannen van het werk, de uitvoering en de administratieve afhandeling.

Vanwege de uitbreiding van onze werkzaamheden op het gebied van de certificering van statische vloeistofhoeveelheidsmeters breiden we ons team uit en is er plaats voor een nieuwe collega: Calibration Technician. Jij kunt hierbij zijn!

De Rotterdamse haven is een begrip waarmee iedereen wel een link heeft. Het is groot, blijft zich ontwikkelen en komt regelmatig in het nieuws. Als je over de haven spreekt, zijn de grote witte ronde landtanks heel herkenbaar. Als Calibration Technician kalibreer, inspecteer en certificeer je landtanks op diverse terminals. Maar wat is zon tank nu precies...?

Als we in vakjargon spreken, hebben we het over Statische Vloeistofhoeveelheidsmeters (SVHM).
In de tank is een vloeibaar product opgeslagen dat verhandeld wordt tussen kopende en verkopende partijen. Het komt ook voor dat het product vanuit de tank naar een fabriek gaat om daar verder verwerkt te worden. De diversiteit aan producten is groot, van ruwe aardolie tot fruitsap.Het is een rond vat met daarop een hoogtemeter die de hoogte van de vloeistof in de tank meet. Jij kalibreert een landtank met behulp van zeer nauwkeurige en hoogwaardige 3D-scanners. De resultaten verwerk je in een inhoudstabel van de tank. Vervolgens moet deze tabel on-site worden geprogrammeerd in de software van de terminal. Dit doe je in nauwe samenwerking met de leverancier van de hoogtemeters. Als laatste stap keur jij de hoogtemeter.Als al deze stappen zijn voltooid, dan mag de eigenaar de tank gebruiken voor de handel. Jouw kennis en kunde zijn essentieel voor onze klant: jij bent de expert op locatie!Wij voeren dit werk uit voor een groot deel van de terminals in de Rotterdamse haven en ook daarbuiten.Je bent in het bezit van een rijbewijs B, mooi want wij regelen het vervoer! Durf jij op hoogte en in kleine ruimtes te werken, dat komt goed uit want wij zoeken iemand die daar de uitdaging in ziet. Deze functie vraagt technisch inzicht en SGS zorgt voor learning on de job.Je hebt een goede kennis van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal. Je kan werken met de computer en het Microsoft-officepakket. Het is handig als je kennis hebt van point cloud processing, maar dat is geen must. Je bent in het bezit van VCA of bent bereid dit certificaat te behalen.De volgende ervaring zien wij graag terug op jouw CV:Een afgeronde Mbo- of hbo-opleiding in de richting van landmeting of werktuigbouw is een prima basis. Maar ook relevante werkervaring kan al voldoende zijn om bij ons aan de slag te gaan.Kennis van en ervaring met (petro) chemische producten, inspectietechnieken, apparatuur en internationale inspectiestandaarden is mooi meegenomen!Als je bij ons komt werken bieden wij je een zelfstandige en afwisselende baan met veel verantwoordelijkheid. Wij besteden veel aandacht aan persoonlijke en professionele groei.
