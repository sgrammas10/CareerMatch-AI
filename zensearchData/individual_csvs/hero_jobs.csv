We love finding new ways to shorten the feedback loops by releasing value to customers in small batches, and therefore learning faster. To do so, our engineering culture and practices are based on eXtreme Programming (XP), Domain-Driven Design, Lean and Continuous Delivery.We believe that the assumption behind the Speed vs Quality mindset is flawed. For us, quality enables speed. We find that engineers seeking to understand our product and business better find more purpose in their work and have better context to innovate and deliver more value to our customers.Role Summary 
Our Central QA unit enables the Product Engineering teams to build on their testing expertise and take ownership of all quality aspects end to end, shortening the feedback loop and allowing us to shift the detection of issues to the left. We believe that humans are creative and excel at finding the important areas that need attention, but machines are better at the repetitive and monotonous execution of testing tasks, which is why we heavily invest in the automation of those efforts. As a Test Automation Engineer II, you will be vital in promoting the highest quality standard across our products and the teams that develop these products. 
The role does not focus on testing, instead, you will guide our product engineers in their journey to shift quality to the left by promoting best practices throughout the organization and engaging with various teams rather than being confined to one. You will also be responsible for exploratory testing activities across the whole app.Key Responsibilities:Problem Solving and Analysis:Pinpoint root causes and implement effective solutionsDraft comprehensive test cases, spot edge cases, and guide others in doing the sameMentor:Equip developers with essential QA tools and knowledgeOrganize regular sync-ups with squads to tackle quality-related issuesEducate:Design and execute workshops and training initiatives for product engineersReinforce QA best practices across all teamsExplore, investigate, and onboard new tools to elevate our QA processesChampion workshops and guide developers toward best quality practicesMonitor:Support interpretation of quality metrics for every teamIdentify and articulate areas necessitating enhancementUndertake risk analysis to anticipate and mitigate potential setbacks The following experience is relevant to us
