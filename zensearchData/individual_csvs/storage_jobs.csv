This type of workwork that changes the worldis what the tech industry was founded on. So, if you're ready to seize the endless opportunities and leave your mark, come join us.THE ROLE
As our Supply Chain Planning Manager, you will be the central owner of our global flash memory supply, ensuring our products are in the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost. Your mission is to develop and execute a resilient end-to-end supply plan that balances delivery performance, cost, and inventory across our complex network of global contract manufacturers (CMs) and component suppliers. You will drive strategic decisions by collaborating closely with commodity management, operations engineering, and business intelligence teams to mitigate risk and ensure the successful launch and lifecycle of our products.
WHAT YOU'LL DO

Own and Execute the Global Supply Plan: You will develop and manage the master supply plan for all flash memory modules and components (NAND/DRAM). This involves translating demand forecasts into actionable build plans for our CMs, ensuring alignment with production schedules from pilot to end-of-life, and proactively resolving supply gaps to achieve delivery, inventory, and cost targets.
Optimize Inventory and Mitigate Risk: You will strategically manage global inventory levels, directing the ordering and fulfillment of components to prevent shortages and minimize excess &amp; obsolete (E&amp;O) inventory. During supply disruptions, you will lead the critical allocation process, making data-driven decisions to balance capacity and serve key business units.
Drive Cross-Functional Alignment and Communication: Serve as the primary supply planning partner to internal teams. You will provide critical feedback on supply risks and opportunities to commodity and backlog management teams, lead EOL planning with demand planning to ensure smooth transitions, and ensure all stakeholders are aligned on the master plan.
Enhance Planning through Data and Analytics: You will create and deliver key reports on supply position, risks, and performance trends for leadership. By partnering with the Business Intelligence (BI) team, you will help develop and automate new planning tools and dashboards, continuously improving forecast accuracy, fill rates, and inventory turnover.
We are primarily an in-office environment and therefore, you will be expected to work from the Santa Clara office in compliance with Pures policies, unless you are on PTO, or work travel, or other approved leave.

WHAT YOU BRING

Expertise in Semiconductor Supply Chain Planning: Demonstrated ability to create and manage complex supply plans within the electronics or semiconductor industry, including a deep understanding of inventory management strategies, forecasting methodologies, and component lifecycle management (NAND/DRAM preferred).
Global Contract Manufacturer (CM) Management: Proven experience directing and collaborating with global CMs and suppliers to align production with demand, manage fulfillment, and ensure performance targets are met.
Advanced Analytical and Systems Skills: Proficiency in leveraging data to identify trends, mitigate risks, and make strategic planning decisions. You are highly skilled with enterprise planning software (such as SAP, Oracle, or Kinaxis) and BI tools (like Power BI or Tableau).
Cross-Functional Leadership and Communication: A strong ability to collaborate with and influence diverse teams (engineering, commodity management, operations) in a fast-paced environment, clearly communicating complex information and driving consensus to resolve issues.
