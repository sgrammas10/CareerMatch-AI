As a Senior Software Engineer - Android Build System, you will work on developing a brand new next-gen build system for Mobile and C++ development at Roblox that is optimized for building in the cloud.
Distributed builds for C++ have been around for some time and have grown in popularity in recent years but Roblox faces novel challenges.  We support consoles, desktops, mobile, and VR platforms, at least some of which are closed and unsupported by any open source or publicly available build system.  We are also aiming for distributed and hermetic builds by construction, even for these platforms that don't make this easy.
You Will:

Help migrate Roblox's existing build system to the new next-gen build system
Work with other teams of engineers internally at the company to understand their workflows and design and develop solutions that meet their needs.
Find, diagnose and fix issues related to the efficiency and correctness of our Android builds from top to bottom.

Creativity: You take a creative and strategic approach to solving hard problems.  Supporting hundreds (if not thousands) of engineers who all have different ideas about how things ought to work should get you thinking about new ways to scale your solutions.
Pragmatism: You understand the balance between complexity and simplicity and can choose solutions that enable the impossible, while still being simple enough that the solutions are bulletproof.

Bonus Points:

Familiarity with functional programming paradigms
Experience building distributed systems
Knowledge of the Bazel Remote Execution API
