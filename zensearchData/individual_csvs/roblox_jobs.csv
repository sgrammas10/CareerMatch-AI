About Client Services
Client Services is the most tactical, reactive, part of Corporate Engineering. Its also the most distributed, with support groups located in each of several buildings occupied by Roblox, as well as a new support group in India. Its also comprised of everything from hourly employees  some of whom are in their first professional role  to tenured, highly experienced, engineers. And as an operational group, it is quite good (were proud of our 98%+ CSAT and our 2.5% reopened ticket rates). It also suffers from some of the classic ills of such teams  were great at responsiveness, but still have room to more thoughtfully grow the members of the team, focus on sustainability, and be more proactive, deliberate, and visionary about how this team improves the effectiveness, efficiency, and experience of the workforce, as well as acting as more of a partner in our engagement with our workforce and our partners and less as a service provider.

Work with your staff to identify where we invest in technology and what these investments look like, focusing on workforce efficiency, experience, and effectiveness (e.g. what is the role of AI chatbots in the support experience? How do we make sure they are a value-add to the people who depend on us to help them?)
Work closely with cross-functional partners (e.g. PeopleOps, Legal, Security, Trust and Safety) to identify opportunities to increase our impact

You Have: 

A diverse people leadership experience, having at one point or another led teams with
