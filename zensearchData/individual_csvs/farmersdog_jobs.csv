What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
Whats a day in the life of a Software Engineer like here? Youll work with a talented engineering pawd to expand and improve our subscription-based, direct-to-consumer, e-commerce platform that delivers fresh food to pets across the country. Big fan of short feedback loops? Youll deliver high quality, well-tested and peer-reviewed code to production in minutes using our automated CI/CD pipeline. Your solutions will leverage industry best practices including A/B experiments, feature toggles and canary rollouts to confidently release high-impact features that dog lovers will love.
At The Farmers Dog collaboration is an imperative. Our team is full of engineers that love to learn and grow. Youll regularly white board, pair program and review architecture with top-notch peers with experience working at Amazon, Google, Disney, and Apple.
We have a great team, but theres still so much to do and figure out. If youre interested in scale and want to be in the room when those architecture decisions are made: youre reading the right job description. Were in that sweet spot of having clear product-market fit, but still having a small enough team that each engineer makes a big impact. Youll work closely with the team to restructure our application architecture to handle our rapid growth at scale.
If you want to have the space and agency to make a big impact both for customers, colleagues and our system: The Farmers Dog is for you. If youre looking for a fully-formed organization with a lot of established processes: a larger company would be a better fit. If youre looking for rapid iteration to find product-market fit: an earlier stage startup would be a better match.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

Youll work with a talented engineering pawd to expand and improve our subscription-based, direct-to-consumer, e-commerce platform that delivers fresh food to pets across the country. Big fan of short feedback loops? Youll deliver high quality, well-tested and peer-reviewed code to production in minutes using our automated CI/CD pipeline. Your solutions will leverage industry best practices including A/B experiments, feature toggles and canary rollouts to confidently release high-impact features that dog lovers will love.

Youll work closely with the team to restructure our application architecture to handle our rapid growth at scale.
If you want to have the space and agency to make a big impact both for customers, colleagues and our system: The Farmers Dog is for you.

We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now?

#LongLiveDogs
What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
We have big ambitions, our mission requires us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates. 
Thats why were looking for an entrepreneurial, strategic, and customer-centric Category Lead, known for their drive in bringing innovative and effective business lines to life. This person will grow a burgeoning new product category for The Farmers Dog platform, design an effective growth strategy and R&amp;D roadmap, manage the P&amp;L to make top and bottom line decisions and craft and execute both longitudinal and A/B/C experiments to scale the business. This is a highly self motivated yet collaborative role. You should be able to be scrappy to make things happen on your own, but also collaborate with R&amp;D, finance, operations, acquisition, brand, product managers, engineering, design, CX and more. As such, your work will be diverse and across all stages of the product life cycle  youll have the opportunity to think big in blue-sky planning sessions as well as go deep with tactical implementation..
What do we believe is important to achieve those goals? Where do we expect you to have an impact?
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

The Farmers Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. Were starting by radically improving the multi-billion dollar pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.
To date, The Farmers Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised significant funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.
#LongLiveDogs
What We Stand For and Where Youll Come In
Are you a dog person who has always thought that there was a better way to deliver service - simply, easily and with love - just like our food? Do you have a desire to engage in meaningful conversations while helping our customers improve the quality of their dogs lives? Are you passionate about the idea of disrupting the pet food industry and providing healthy human grade food for dogs?
Our Customer Experience Department (CX) is looking for people who will be the eyes and ears of our customer service organization. We need people who can consistently deliver a positive, world class customer experience via phone, email, and text. Our goal is to resolve customer queries with fast, friendly, and courteous service.
Service can include responding to inquiries regarding billing, delivery status, account information, updating payments methods, nutritional information and general questions about subscriptions.
This opportunity is a full-time role of 40 hours per week. Candidates must be able to commute to and work from at our Florida office on-site.
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing: Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions: We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

The Farmers Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. Were starting by radically improving the ninety billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.
To date, The Farmers Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.

What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In
We have big ambitions, our mission is to give dog lovers true peace of mind by helping them do the best for their dogs  this will require us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates. 
One Team: We dont think of ourselves as Acquisition Marketers, Engineers, Data Analysts, or Product Managers. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we dont think departments matter. Wed rather align ourselves to the goals were working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER  getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we arent tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know theres a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
We Execute For Impact: We dont subscribe to best practices or industry KPIs. Were uninterested in how we compare to benchmarks; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we dont subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles  i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, whats the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We dont expect to be perfect the first time.

We dont believe this is possible by implementing best practices or operating how the rest of the industry operates.
Thats why were looking for a highly innovative, strategic, and principles-driven Director of Influencer and Partnerships to lead efforts for The Farmers Dog, taking our programs to unimagined levels of efficiency, sustainability, and scale.
The Director of Influencer and Partnerships plays a vital role in our mission by owning programs aimed at finding, developing, and partnering with advocates of The Farmers Dog across a variety of strategies and sources.  This includes but is not limited to affiliates, influencers, and large strategic partnerships with organizations, celebrities, brands and entities. This person is excellent at prioritization, negotiation, and establishing lenses of measurement so that they and their team can triangulate and build hypotheses on impact and efficacy of efforts holistically. The Director of Influencer &amp; Partnerships has a diverse background in Growth Marketing and has successfully integrated partnerships of various structures and sizes into the core channel mix. 
You should be intuitively holistic in your approach, an excellent communicator, and hyper-focused on driving maximum business impact today and over time. Youll have the opportunity to take the foundation we have in place (including an existing team of high-performing operators) and evolve it to establish The Farmers Dog as the leading trusted pet care brand and the best option for dogs.

How You'll Make An Impact
One of the amazing things about not subscribing to the traditional and classic definitions of roles is that we expect you to have an active hand in shaping this role and what youll focus on. The below is meant to be an illustrative list of the kinds of initiatives you might work on, but its not meant to be comprehensive nor prescriptive.

Lead and develop a high-impact team responsible for scaling and improving our existing partnerships portfolio. You are excellent at leading through others, have high expectations, are direct and empathetic with feedback, and are eager to continuously surpass our goals and re-define best-in-class.
Drive sustainable growth in Influencer, Affiliate, and Partnerships, ensuring we invest responsibly yet boldly, leveraging innovative strategies to meet an evolving customer base in the right place, at the right time, with the right message. Balance short term impact with long term growth. Model and communicate the value and impact of all initiatives for effective prioritization.
Bring thought-leadership to the department overall, because you know that no interaction exists in a silo and everything works together and therefore you have perspective and opinions on just about every channel and initiative across the customer journey.
Champion a thorough experimentation culture within your function that balances and includes incremental building and big bets. OKRs are designed with this mindset.
Build a data-guided and high decision-quality culture. Both individually and collectively dive deep in our data (which includes talking to customers &amp; leads often) to uncover insights that allow us to methodically remove friction from the experience across key customer segments and expedite movement through the pre-checkout portion of this journey.
You are recognized as an excellent person to partner with externally - because you operate with the highest levels of integrity, are very direct and have high expectations for partners yet are always fair and collaborative.  People want to work with you.  This includes excellent negotiation skills.

We're Excited About You Because
There is no single background or set of experiences that were beholden to. Confident you could drive impact in the areas outlined above? Apply and let us know why. The below is the kind of backgrounds were most excited about currently.

You have demonstrated your ability to build, negotiate, manage, and scale many Influencer, affiliate, and brand partnerships. Youve done this in a bold, holistic, and customer-focused manner. Youve used your hands-on experience to design and execute holistic, innovative, effective strategies.
You are an exceptional people manager. You expect a lot, but you support your team along the way. You empower your reports and create cultures and ceremonies/feedback loops so that everyone can and should operate with autonomy. You encourage feedback and debate from your function and across all levels. You are passionate about developing talent.
You lead through others - you dont need to be the one to do all the things to have an outsized impact, and your impact should be felt across the entire organization.
You have demonstrated excellent intuition yet are also analytical, and can tell a story from a set of data.  There are clear examples of opportunity identification and pattern matching in your career. This could be experience in data analytics/insights, media, scaling businesses, and/or other entrepreneurial endeavors. You should be excited about using those skill sets to improve our operations.
You are a maximizer - you continue to set the bar higher for yourself and those you work and partner with.
You thrive in high pressure, high stakes environments. You have natural drive and you work hard. You maintain early stage startup intensity at any scale.
Youre not afraid to disagree, and yet you can also comfortably admit when you were wrong.
You are skeptical, peek around corners effectively and continuously, and you are right the first time most of the time.
