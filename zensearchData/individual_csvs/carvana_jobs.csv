At Carvana, we sell cars, but were not salespeople. Since 2013, weve been making it our mission to change the way people buy cars. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way, so we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world  the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, thats $Trillion with a T).
With the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360 photographs of our vehicles interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device. All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right). By putting customer satisfaction at the core of our business, weve built a no-pressure, no-haggle online car buying experience that save our customers time and money.
