We believe CVNA is in the early stages of becoming the next U.S. retail category killer. 
 Stephens Investment Bank, Analyst Report, Sept. 2024
Building leading-edge technology has been at the core of Carvanas strategy since our founding, driving us to become the 3rd fastest company in history to organically reach the Fortune 500 following only Amazon and Google. Today, we remain founder-lead and as ambitious as ever. In 2024, we have not only emerged as the fastest growing automotive retailer, but also the most profitable thanks to our deep vertical integration across retail, lending, vehicle transportation, wholesale auctions, and more. 
If you want to grow not just as a leader but as a business-builder, Carvana is the place for you. Our technology teams build:

End-to-end ecommerce for both selling and buying cars, including everything you see on Carvana.com and in our mobile apps.
AI-driven customer support across chat, email, SMS, and voice, as well as a proprietary CRM platform to ensure the most efficient and highest quality customer experience.

Early adoption and customization of AI tools for optimizing our Developer efficiency and experience.

And much, much more...
This role is 100% on-site at our Tempe Town Lake HQ, Monday through Friday.
About the team and position
Marketplace is a division of Carvana focused on our B2B offerings. Weve already built a two billion dollar business (Sell to Carvana and Carvana Wholesale) and acquired a third (ADESA). The internal infrastructure - systems, processes, people - weve built to power Carvanas tech-forward business can power thousands more for our B2B customers and partners in the automotive industry. Think Amazon and FBA, Google and GCP - were taking our secret sauce, packaging it up, and making it available to others who also want to create best-in-class automotive businesses. 
As a Senior Product Manager on the Vehicle Representation team, youll play a key role in helping us build the best vehicle visualization and condition representation in the industry. We want to make buying wholesale cars online more trustworthy and efficient for dealers than buying in person, just like weve done with Carvana.com for consumers buying retail used cars. In keeping with our great tradition of innovation youll be working to modernize the space with cutting-edge technology like AI-based damage detection, mobile, high-quality imaging systems, and intelligent search and recommendation engines.
At Carvana being a Product Manager goes beyond technology. Your product is your business and youll need to think about the impact your products have not just on customer experience, but also how theyre powered by distributed operational and logistics teams. Think of it as taking your pure-tech PM skills to the next level. 
We believe our experience is great because our people are great. Investing in our people is fundamental to building a great company and customer experience. Expect support and partnership from those around you. Many of our best leaders come from within.
Responsibilities
We need people who are comfortable making decisions without an answer to every question, finding solutions to problems that havent been solved, and designing products that no one has attempted. We find that those types of people tend to be great at data, great at working across teams, and laser-focused on building a great customer experience. 
Were doing more than just building an app, were building end-to-end businesses - from the ground up. That means you have to be willing to scale down and up alongside the needs of the business - from running SQL queries to cementing strategic partnerships. 
In addition to all the traditional Product Manager duties, we expect you to:

Develop and evangelize your teams mission, strategy, and objectives with both internal and external partners
Work with executives and strategic partnerships to evaluate and make high-impact investments in physical/operational technology and R&amp;D
Conduct competitive analyses to recommend and place product roadmap bets towards out-innovating industry-leading incumbents
Work directly with large, raw datasets to meticulously transform them into intelligible, customer-facing products
Take day-to-day ownership and execution responsibility for various product (and occasionally, non-product) initiatives
Act as the main point of contact for and driver of cross-functional collaboration with a large field operations organization across many locations nationwide
Use qualitative and quantitative research and analysis methods to investigate customers frustrations and unmet needs and creatively identify product development opportunities
Own initiative shaping, scoping, and requirements drafting to enable effective engineering execution
Write clear project briefs and detailed requirements to effectively communicate with the team and align all stakeholders around a common understanding of what and why
Creatively explore ways to speed up time-to-value, reduce risk, and increase the pace of learning through prototyping, pilot testing, and other forms of validation
