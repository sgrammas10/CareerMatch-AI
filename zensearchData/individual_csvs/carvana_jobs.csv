About the team and position
The Senior Analyst, Space Planning at ADESA (owned by Carvana) will play a pivotal role in optimizing the layout and efficiency of our inspection centers and auction facilities. As Carvana continues to grow and ADESAs auctioning facilities play a major role, this position is an exciting opportunity to contribute to the success by ensuring smooth, organized, and efficient use of our auction spaces.
This position involves analyzing and interpreting data to ensure the most effective use of space, accommodating various vehicle sizes and maximizing storage capacity. This person will collaborate closely with operational teams to identify areas for improvement and implement strategic plans that enhance workflow, reduce congestion, and improve the strategies for how we grow our auction and reconditioning capabilities.
Key responsibilities include creating detailed space utilization models and reports, developing innovative layout solutions, and monitoring the effectiveness of implemented changes. The ideal candidate will possess strong analytical skills, experience in space planning or logistics, and knowledge of SQL (ideally using Snowflake!). 
What youll be doing

Using Your Technical Chops:

SQL isn't just a language, it's our daily dialect. It's the tool that empowers us to dive deep and make sense of our data.
Youll be a wizard with business intelligence tools like Tableau or another visualization tool.
As a visual storyteller, you'll transform raw, unstructured data into compelling narratives, meticulously choosing the most effective visualizations. Your craftsmanship will turn information into inspiration, distilling data into precise insights that captivate and inspire.
Your curiosity won't just drive you, it'll define you. Your technical ability and statistical knowledge won't allow you to be content with just scratching the surface; you'll dig deeper to find the truth in the data, the story behind the numbers.


Being A Stellar Partner:

You initiate and drive analyses that lead to operational improvement and process optimization across reconditioning, fulfillment and inventory quality.
Your unwavering commitment to execution will see you setting and exceeding expectations. Your self-motivated approach will result in well-executed plans, delivering constant value to the organization.
You will work with others to understand business processes and deliver data so that non-technical resources can understand and respond as needed.
You'll efficiently break down complex problems using logical reasoning.



What you should have

Bachelors degree in Business Administration, Economics, Engineering, Finance, Math, Supply Chain, or similar field from an accredited undergraduate institution required.
2-4+ years of experience in data, reporting, or analytics.
2-4+ years of experience working on projects related to space planning or network optimization.
Strong analytical skills with proficiency in SQL. 
Knowledge of visualization software, such as Tableau.
The ability to work cross-functionally with engineering, data science, and business teams and communicate across them in a clear and concise manner understood by all. 
You have the flexibility to move and shake with competing and changing priorities.
