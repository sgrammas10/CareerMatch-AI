At Airbnb, we want to build a world where anyone can belong anywhere – and the first step in that direction is creating a community that’s open, inclusive, and built on trust. In a world where our digital presence and identity is as important as our physical presence, we believe that a fundamental part of earning this trust is by ensuring that we protect our users, the data they entrust to us, and our infrastructure. At Airbnb, our Information Security practices, and resulting trust, are part of the reason users choose to use and continue using our products.
The Information Security team plays a critical role in maintaining and building our community’s trust in our platform that enables millions of users to explore the world and belong anywhere.

You have a demonstrated ability to see the interconnectedness of not only the immediate problem you’re solving for, but also those of other organizations to unify cross-functional stakeholders to deliver solutions that are best for Airbnb vs. a single business unit.
Self-motivated, proactive and proven ability to adapt well and work with teams having different operating cadences and breadth of subject matter backgrounds.
Provide sound business judgment, a proven ability to influence others, strong analytical skills, and a track record of taking ownership, leading data driven analyses, and influencing results.
