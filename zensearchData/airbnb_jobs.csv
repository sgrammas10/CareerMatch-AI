Identity Team 
Join our team at Airbnb and play a crucial role in enhancing transparency and trust within our global community! We pride ourselves on using identity verification as a powerful tool to build trust among our users. This team works with design, product, privacy/legal, operations, and other engineering teams to verify users are who they say they are and build trust on the platform. If you're passionate about developing cutting-edge solutions that drive positive impacts on a global scale, join us on this exciting journey to foster a safer and more trustworthy Airbnb community!
What problems are we solving on Identity?
Streamlining verification with modern technologies
We are tackling the challenge of making identity verification seamless and secure. Traditional verification methods can create friction, leading to user drop-offs and lower conversion rates. To improve the experience, we are exploring innovative solutions that leverage trusted digital identities and emerging technologies to streamline verification while maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance. As a part of the team, you’ll be shaping the future of frictionless identity verification at scale!
 
Localized Verification
We are tackling the challenge of making identity verification more accessible and effective across diverse regions. A global approach doesn’t always align with local needs, which can create friction for users. We’re exploring ways to adapt verification experiences to different markets, ensuring a seamless and trusted process while maintaining security and compliance.
 
Secure and Resilient Identity Verification  
As fraud tactics evolve, staying ahead of bad actors is a constant challenge. Traditional identity verification methods can become less effective over time, requiring more advanced solutions to maintain security and trust. We are exploring innovative approaches to strengthen verification, enhance fraud detection, and ensure a seamless experience for legitimate users.
